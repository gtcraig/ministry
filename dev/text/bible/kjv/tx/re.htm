<DT><A NAME="1:1">1:1</A><DD>The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto him, to shew unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass; and he sent and signified <I>it</I> by his angel unto his servant John:
<DT><A NAME="1:2">1:2</A><DD>Who bare record of the word of God, and of the testimony of Jesus Christ, and of all things that he saw.
<DT><A NAME="1:3">1:3</A><DD>Blessed <I>is</I> he that readeth, and they that hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which are written therein: for the time <I>is</I> at hand.
<DT><A NAME="1:4">1:4</A><DD>John to the seven churches which are in Asia: Grace <I>be</I> unto you, and peace, from him which is, and which was, and which is to come; and from the seven Spirits which are before his throne;
<DT><A NAME="1:5">1:5</A><DD>And from Jesus Christ, <I>who is</I> the faithful witness, <I>and</I> the first begotten of the dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth. Unto him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood,
<DT><A NAME="1:6">1:6</A><DD>And hath made us kings and priests unto God and his Father; to him <I>be</I> glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.
<DT><A NAME="1:7">1:7</A><DD>Behold, he cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see him, and they <I>also</I> which pierced him: and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him. Even so, Amen.
<DT><A NAME="1:8">1:8</A><DD><FONT CLASS=r>I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending,</FONT> saith the Lord, which is, and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty.
<DT><A NAME="1:9">1:9</A><DD>I John, who also am your brother, and companion in tribulation, and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ, was in the isle that is called Patmos, for the word of God, and for the testimony of Jesus Christ.
<DT><A NAME="1:10">1:10</A><DD>I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and heard behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet,
<DT><A NAME="1:11">1:11</A><DD>Saying, <FONT CLASS=r>I am Alpha and Omega, the first and the last:</FONT> and, <FONT CLASS=r>What thou seest, write in a book, and send <I>it</I> unto the seven churches which are in Asia; unto Ephesus, and unto Smyrna, and unto Pergamos, and unto Thyatira, and unto Sardis, and unto Philadelphia, and unto Laodicea.</FONT>
<DT><A NAME="1:12">1:12</A><DD>And I turned to see the voice that spake with me. And being turned, I saw seven golden candlesticks;
<DT><A NAME="1:13">1:13</A><DD>And in the midst of the seven candlesticks <I>one</I> like unto the Son of man, clothed with a garment down to the foot, and girt about the paps with a golden girdle.
<DT><A NAME="1:14">1:14</A><DD>His head and <I>his</I> hairs <I>were</I> white like wool, as white as snow; and his eyes <I>were</I> as a flame of fire;
<DT><A NAME="1:15">1:15</A><DD>And his feet like unto fine brass, as if they burned in a furnace; and his voice as the sound of many waters.
<DT><A NAME="1:16">1:16</A><DD>And he had in his right hand seven stars: and out of his mouth went a sharp twoedged sword: and his countenance <I>was</I> as the sun shineth in his strength.
<DT><A NAME="1:17">1:17</A><DD>And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead. And he laid his right hand upon me, saying unto me, <FONT CLASS=r>Fear not; I am the first and the last:</FONT>
<DT><A NAME="1:18">1:18</A><DD><FONT CLASS=r>I <I>am</I> he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore, Amen; and have the keys of hell and of death.</FONT>

<DT><A NAME="1:20">1:20</A><DD><FONT CLASS=r>The mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in my right hand, and the seven golden candlesticks. The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches: and the seven candlesticks which thou sawest are the seven churches.</FONT>
</DL></DIV><H2>Chapter 2</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="2:1">2:1</A><DD><FONT CLASS=r>Unto the angel of the church of Ephesus write; These things saith he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand, who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks;</FONT>
<DT><A NAME="2:2">2:2</A><DD><FONT CLASS=r>I know thy works, and thy labour, and thy patience, and how thou canst not bear them which are evil: and thou hast tried them which say they are apostles, and are not, and hast found them liars:</FONT>
<DT><A NAME="2:3">2:3</A><DD><FONT CLASS=r>And hast borne, and hast patience, and for my name's sake hast laboured, and hast not fainted.</FONT>
<DT><A NAME="2:4">2:4</A><DD><FONT CLASS=r>Nevertheless I have <I>somewhat</I> against thee, because thou hast left thy first love.</FONT>
<DT><A NAME="2:5">2:5</A><DD><FONT CLASS=r>Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the first works; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will remove thy candlestick out of his place, except thou repent.</FONT>
<DT><A NAME="2:6">2:6</A><DD><FONT CLASS=r>But this thou hast, that thou hatest the deeds of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate.</FONT>

<DT><A NAME="2:8">2:8</A><DD><FONT CLASS=r>And unto the angel of the church in Smyrna write; These things saith the first and the last, which was dead, and is alive;</FONT>
<DT><A NAME="2:9">2:9</A><DD><FONT CLASS=r>I know thy works, and tribulation, and poverty, (but thou art rich) and <I>I know</I> the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews, and are not, but <I>are</I> the synagogue of Satan.</FONT>
<DT><A NAME="2:10">2:10</A><DD><FONT CLASS=r>Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer: behold, the devil shall cast <I>some</I> of you into prison, that ye may be tried; and ye shall have tribulation ten days: be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life.</FONT>
<DT><A NAME="2:11">2:11</A><DD><FONT CLASS=r>He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; He that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death.</FONT>
<DT><A NAME="2:12">2:12</A><DD><FONT CLASS=r>And to the angel of the church in Pergamos write; These things saith he which hath the sharp sword with two edges;</FONT>
<DT><A NAME="2:13">2:13</A><DD><FONT CLASS=r>I know thy works, and where thou dwellest, <I>even</I> where Satan's seat <I>is</I>: and thou holdest fast my name, and hast not denied my faith, even in those days wherein Antipas <I>was</I> my faithful martyr, who was slain among you, where Satan dwelleth.</FONT>
<DT><A NAME="2:14">2:14</A><DD><FONT CLASS=r>But I have a few things against thee, because thou hast there them that hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balac to cast a stumblingblock before the children of Israel, to eat things sacrificed unto idols, and to commit fornication.</FONT>
<DT><A NAME="2:15">2:15</A><DD><FONT CLASS=r>So hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitans, which thing I hate.</FONT>
<DT><A NAME="2:16">2:16</A><DD><FONT CLASS=r>Repent; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth.</FONT>
<DT><A NAME="2:17">2:17</A><DD><FONT CLASS=r>He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden manna, and will give him a white stone, and in the stone a new name written, which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth <I>it</I>.</FONT>
<DT><A NAME="2:18">2:18</A><DD><FONT CLASS=r>And unto the angel of the church in Thyatira write; These things saith the Son of God, who hath his eyes like unto a flame of fire, and his feet <I>are</I> like fine brass;</FONT>
<DT><A NAME="2:19">2:19</A><DD><FONT CLASS=r>I know thy works, and charity, and service, and faith, and thy patience, and thy works; and the last <I>to be</I> more than the first.</FONT>
<DT><A NAME="2:20">2:20</A><DD><FONT CLASS=r>Notwithstanding I have a few things against thee, because thou sufferest that woman Jezebel, which calleth herself a prophetess, to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication, and to eat things sacrificed unto idols.</FONT>
<DT><A NAME="2:21">2:21</A><DD><FONT CLASS=r>And I gave her space to repent of her fornication; and she repented not.</FONT>
<DT><A NAME="2:22">2:22</A><DD><FONT CLASS=r>Behold, I will cast her into a bed, and them that commit adultery with her into great tribulation, except they repent of their deeds.</FONT>
<DT><A NAME="2:23">2:23</A><DD><FONT CLASS=r>And I will kill her children with death; and all the churches shall know that I am he which searcheth the reins and hearts: and I will give unto every one of you according to your works.</FONT>
<DT><A NAME="2:24">2:24</A><DD><FONT CLASS=r>But unto you I say, and unto the rest in Thyatira, as many as have not this doctrine, and which have not known the depths of Satan, as they speak; I will put upon you none other burden.</FONT>

<DT><A NAME="4:1">4:1</A><DD>After this I looked, and, behold, a door <I>was</I> opened in heaven: and the first voice which I heard <I>was</I> as it were of a trumpet talking with me; which said, Come up hither, and I will shew thee things which must be hereafter.
<DT><A NAME="4:2">4:2</A><DD>And immediately I was in the spirit: and, behold, a throne was set in heaven, and <I>one</I> sat on the throne.
<DT><A NAME="4:3">4:3</A><DD>And he that sat was to look upon like a jasper and a sardine stone: and <I>there was</I> a rainbow round about the throne, in sight like unto an emerald.
<DT><A NAME="4:4">4:4</A><DD>And round about the throne <I>were</I> four and twenty seats: and upon the seats I saw four and twenty elders sitting, clothed in white raiment; and they had on their heads crowns of gold.
<DT><A NAME="4:5">4:5</A><DD>And out of the throne proceeded lightnings and thunderings and voices: and <I>there were</I> seven lamps of fire burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God.
<DT><A NAME="4:6">4:6</A><DD>And before the throne <I>there was</I> a sea of glass like unto crystal: and in the midst of the throne, and round about the throne, <I>were</I> four beasts full of eyes before and behind.
<DT><A NAME="4:7">4:7</A><DD>And the first beast <I>was</I> like a lion, and the second beast like a calf, and the third beast had a face as a man, and the fourth beast <I>was</I> like a flying eagle.
<DT><A NAME="4:8">4:8</A><DD>And the four beasts had each of them six wings about <I>him</I>; and <I>they were</I> full of eyes within: and they rest not day and night, saying, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, which was, and is, and is to come.
<DT><A NAME="4:9">4:9</A><DD>And when those beasts give glory and honour and thanks to him that sat on the throne, who liveth for ever and ever,
<DT><A NAME="4:10">4:10</A><DD>The four and twenty elders fall down before him that sat on the throne, and worship him that liveth for ever and ever, and cast their crowns before the throne, saying,
<DT><A NAME="4:11">4:11</A><DD>Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honour and power: for thou hast created all things, and for thy pleasure they are and were created.
</DL></DIV><H2>Chapter 5</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="5:1">5:1</A><DD>And I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside, sealed with seven seals.
<DT><A NAME="5:2">5:2</A><DD>And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, Who is worthy to open the book, and to loose the seals thereof?
<DT><A NAME="5:3">5:3</A><DD>And no man in heaven, nor in earth, neither under the earth, was able to open the book, neither to look thereon.
<DT><A NAME="5:4">5:4</A><DD>And I wept much, because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book, neither to look thereon.
<DT><A NAME="5:5">5:5</A><DD>And one of the elders saith unto me, Weep not: behold, the Lion of the tribe of Juda, the Root of David, hath prevailed to open the book, and to loose the seven seals thereof.
<DT><A NAME="5:6">5:6</A><DD>And I beheld, and, lo, in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts, and in the midst of the elders, stood a Lamb as it had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth.
<DT><A NAME="5:7">5:7</A><DD>And he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne.
<DT><A NAME="5:8">5:8</A><DD>And when he had taken the book, the four beasts and four <I>and</I> twenty elders fell down before the Lamb, having every one of them harps, and golden vials full of odours, which are the prayers of saints.
<DT><A NAME="5:9">5:9</A><DD>And they sung a new song, saying, Thou art worthy to take the book, and to open the seals thereof: for thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation;
<DT><A NAME="5:10">5:10</A><DD>And hast made us unto our God kings and priests: and we shall reign on the earth.
<DT><A NAME="5:11">5:11</A><DD>And I beheld, and I heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and the beasts and the elders: and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands;
<DT><A NAME="5:12">5:12</A><DD>Saying with a loud voice, Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honour, and glory, and blessing.
<DT><A NAME="5:13">5:13</A><DD>And every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them, heard I saying, Blessing, and honour, and glory, and power, <I>be</I> unto him that sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb for ever and ever.
<DT><A NAME="5:14">5:14</A><DD>And the four beasts said, Amen. And the four <I>and</I> twenty elders fell down and worshipped him that liveth for ever and ever.
</DL></DIV><H2>Chapter 6</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="6:1">6:1</A><DD>And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seals, and I heard, as it were the noise of thunder, one of the four beasts saying, Come and see.
<DT><A NAME="6:2">6:2</A><DD>And I saw, and behold a white horse: and he that sat on him had a bow; and a crown was given unto him: and he went forth conquering, and to conquer.
<DT><A NAME="6:3">6:3</A><DD>And when he had opened the second seal, I heard the second beast say, Come and see.
