<H2>Chapter 1</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="1:1">1:1</A><DD>Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God's elect, and the acknowledging of the truth which is after godliness;
<DT><A NAME="1:2">1:2</A><DD>In hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot lie, promised before the world began;
<DT><A NAME="1:3">1:3</A><DD>But hath in due times manifested his word through preaching, which is committed unto me according to the commandment of God our Saviour;
<DT><A NAME="1:4">1:4</A><DD>To Titus, <I>mine</I> own son after the common faith: Grace, mercy, <I>and</I> peace, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Saviour.
<DT><A NAME="1:5">1:5</A><DD>For this cause left I thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set in order the things that are wanting, and ordain elders in every city, as I had appointed thee:
<DT><A NAME="1:6">1:6</A><DD>If any be blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful children not accused of riot or unruly.
<DT><A NAME="1:7">1:7</A><DD>For a bishop must be blameless, as the steward of God; not selfwilled, not soon angry, not given to wine, no striker, not given to filthy lucre;
<DT><A NAME="1:8">1:8</A><DD>But a lover of hospitality, a lover of good men, sober, just, holy, temperate;
<DT><A NAME="1:9">1:9</A><DD>Holding fast the faithful word as he hath been taught, that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the gainsayers.
<DT><A NAME="1:10">1:10</A><DD>For there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers, specially they of the circumcision:
<DT><A NAME="1:11">1:11</A><DD>Whose mouths must be stopped, who subvert whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for filthy lucre's sake.
<DT><A NAME="1:12">1:12</A><DD>One of themselves, <I>even</I> a prophet of their own, said, The Cretians <I>are</I> alway liars, evil beasts, slow bellies.
<DT><A NAME="1:13">1:13</A><DD>This witness is true. Wherefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith;
<DT><A NAME="1:14">1:14</A><DD>Not giving heed to Jewish fables, and commandments of men, that turn from the truth.
<DT><A NAME="1:15">1:15</A><DD>Unto the pure all things <I>are</I> pure: but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving <I>is</I> nothing pure; but even their mind and conscience is defiled.
<DT><A NAME="1:16">1:16</A><DD>They profess that they know God; but in works they deny <I>him</I>, being abominable, and disobedient, and unto every good work reprobate.
</DL></DIV><H2>Chapter 2</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="2:1">2:1</A><DD>But speak thou the things which become sound doctrine:
<DT><A NAME="2:2">2:2</A><DD>That the aged men be sober, grave, temperate, sound in faith, in charity, in patience.
<DT><A NAME="2:3">2:3</A><DD>The aged women likewise, that <I>they be</I> in behaviour as becometh holiness, not false accusers, not given to much wine, teachers of good things;
<DT><A NAME="2:4">2:4</A><DD>That they may teach the young women to be sober, to love their husbands, to love their children,
<DT><A NAME="2:5">2:5</A><DD><I>To be</I> discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good, obedient to their own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed.
<DT><A NAME="2:6">2:6</A><DD>Young men likewise exhort to be sober minded.
<DT><A NAME="2:7">2:7</A><DD>In all things shewing thyself a pattern of good works: in doctrine <I>shewing</I> uncorruptness, gravity, sincerity,
<DT><A NAME="2:8">2:8</A><DD>Sound speech, that cannot be condemned; that he that is of the contrary part may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say of you.
<DT><A NAME="2:9">2:9</A><DD><I>Exhort</I> servants to be obedient unto their own masters, <I>and</I> to please <I>them</I> well in all <I>things</I>; not answering again;
<DT><A NAME="2:10">2:10</A><DD>Not purloining, but shewing all good fidelity; that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things.
<DT><A NAME="2:11">2:11</A><DD>For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men,
<DT><A NAME="2:12">2:12</A><DD>Teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world;
<DT><A NAME="2:13">2:13</A><DD>Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ;
<DT><A NAME="2:14">2:14</A><DD>Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.
<DT><A NAME="2:15">2:15</A><DD>These things speak, and exhort, and rebuke with all authority. Let no man despise thee.
</DL></DIV><H2>Chapter 3</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="3:1">3:1</A><DD>Put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers, to obey magistrates, to be ready to every good work,
<DT><A NAME="3:2">3:2</A><DD>To speak evil of no man, to be no brawlers, <I>but</I> gentle, shewing all meekness unto all men.
<DT><A NAME="3:3">3:3</A><DD>For we ourselves also were sometimes foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, <I>and</I> hating one another.
<DT><A NAME="3:4">3:4</A><DD>But after that the kindness and love of God our Saviour toward man appeared,
<DT><A NAME="3:5">3:5</A><DD>Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost;
<DT><A NAME="3:6">3:6</A><DD>Which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour;
<DT><A NAME="3:7">3:7</A><DD>That being justified by his grace, we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.
<DT><A NAME="3:8">3:8</A><DD><I>This is</I> a faithful saying, and these things I will that thou affirm constantly, that they which have believed in God might be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable unto men.
<DT><A NAME="3:9">3:9</A><DD>But avoid foolish questions, and genealogies, and contentions, and strivings about the law; for they are unprofitable and vain.
<DT><A NAME="3:10">3:10</A><DD>A man that is an heretick after the first and second admonition reject;
<DT><A NAME="3:11">3:11</A><DD>Knowing that he that is such is subverted, and sinneth, being condemned of himself.
<DT><A NAME="3:12">3:12</A><DD>When I shall send Artemas unto thee, or Tychicus, be diligent to come unto me to Nicopolis: for I have determined there to winter.
<DT><A NAME="3:13">3:13</A><DD>Bring Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey diligently, that nothing be wanting unto them.
<DT><A NAME="3:14">3:14</A><DD>And let ours also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses, that they be not unfruitful.
<DT><A NAME="3:15">3:15</A><DD>All that are with me salute thee. Greet them that love us in the faith. Grace <I>be</I> with you all. Amen.
