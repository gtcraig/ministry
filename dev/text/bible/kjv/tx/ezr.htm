<DT><A NAME="1:1">1:1</A><DD>Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word of the LORD by the mouth of Jeremiah might be fulfilled, the LORD stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom, and <I>put it</I> also in writing, saying,
<DT><A NAME="1:2">1:2</A><DD>Thus saith Cyrus king of Persia, The LORD God of heaven hath given me all the kingdoms of the earth; and he hath charged me to build him an house at Jerusalem, which <I>is</I> in Judah.

<DT><A NAME="1:5">1:5</A><DD>Then rose up the chief of the fathers of Judah and Benjamin, and the priests, and the Levites, with all <I>them</I> whose spirit God had raised, to go up to build the house of the LORD which <I>is</I> in Jerusalem.
<DT><A NAME="1:6">1:6</A><DD>And all they that <I>were</I> about them strengthened their hands with vessels of silver, with gold, with goods, and with beasts, and with precious things, beside all <I>that</I> was willingly offered.
<DT><A NAME="1:7">1:7</A><DD>Also Cyrus the king brought forth the vessels of the house of the LORD, which Nebuchadnezzar had brought forth out of Jerusalem, and had put them in the house of his gods;

<DT><A NAME="3:1">3:1</A><DD>And when the seventh month was come, and the children of Israel <I>were</I> in the cities, the people gathered themselves together as one man to Jerusalem.
<DT><A NAME="3:2">3:2</A><DD>Then stood up Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and his brethren the priests, and Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and his brethren, and builded the altar of the God of Israel, to offer burnt offerings thereon, as <I>it is</I> written in the law of Moses the man of God.
<DT><A NAME="3:3">3:3</A><DD>And they set the altar upon his bases; for fear <I>was</I> upon them because of the people of those countries: and they offered burnt offerings thereon unto the LORD, <I>even</I> burnt offerings morning and evening.
<DT><A NAME="3:4">3:4</A><DD>They kept also the feast of tabernacles, as <I>it is</I> written, and <I>offered</I> the daily burnt offerings by number, according to the custom, as the duty of every day required;

<DT><A NAME="3:6">3:6</A><DD>From the first day of the seventh month began they to offer burnt offerings unto the LORD. But the foundation of the temple of the LORD was not <I>yet</I> laid.
<DT><A NAME="3:7">3:7</A><DD>They gave money also unto the masons, and to the carpenters; and meat, and drink, and oil, unto them of Zidon, and to them of Tyre, to bring cedar trees from Lebanon to the sea of Joppa, according to the grant that they had of Cyrus king of Persia.
<DT><A NAME="3:8">3:8</A><DD>Now in the second year of their coming unto the house of God at Jerusalem, in the second month, began Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and the remnant of their brethren the priests and the Levites, and all they that were come out of the captivity unto Jerusalem; and appointed the Levites, from twenty years old and upward, to set forward the work of the house of the LORD.
<DT><A NAME="3:9">3:9</A><DD>Then stood Jeshua <I>with</I> his sons and his brethren, Kadmiel and his sons, the sons of Judah, together, to set forward the workmen in the house of God: the sons of Henadad, <I>with</I> their sons and their brethren the Levites.
<DT><A NAME="3:10">3:10</A><DD>And when the builders laid the foundation of the temple of the LORD, they set the priests in their apparel with trumpets, and the Levites the sons of Asaph with cymbals, to praise the LORD, after the ordinance of David king of Israel.
<DT><A NAME="3:11">3:11</A><DD>And they sang together by course in praising and giving thanks unto the LORD; because <I>he is</I> good, for his mercy <I>endureth</I> for ever toward Israel. And all the people shouted with a great shout, when they praised the LORD, because the foundation of the house of the LORD was laid.
<DT><A NAME="3:12">3:12</A><DD>But many of the priests and Levites and chief of the fathers, <I>who were</I> ancient men, that had seen the first house, when the foundation of this house was laid before their eyes, wept with a loud voice; and many shouted aloud for joy:
<DT><A NAME="3:13">3:13</A><DD>So that the people could not discern the noise of the shout of joy from the noise of the weeping of the people: for the people shouted with a loud shout, and the noise was heard afar off.
</DL></DIV><H2>Chapter 4</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="4:1">4:1</A><DD>Now when the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin heard that the children of the captivity builded the temple unto the LORD God of Israel;
<DT><A NAME="4:2">4:2</A><DD>Then they came to Zerubbabel, and to the chief of the fathers, and said unto them, Let us build with you: for we seek your God, as ye <I>do</I>; and we do sacrifice unto him since the days of Esarhaddon king of Assur, which brought us up hither.
<DT><A NAME="4:3">4:3</A><DD>But Zerubbabel, and Jeshua, and the rest of the chief of the fathers of Israel, said unto them, Ye have nothing to do with us to build an house unto our God; but we ourselves together will build unto the LORD God of Israel, as king Cyrus the king of Persia hath commanded us.
<DT><A NAME="4:4">4:4</A><DD>Then the people of the land weakened the hands of the people of Judah, and troubled them in building,
<DT><A NAME="4:5">4:5</A><DD>And hired counsellors against them, to frustrate their purpose, all the days of Cyrus king of Persia, even until the reign of Darius king of Persia.
<DT><A NAME="4:6">4:6</A><DD>And in the reign of Ahasuerus, in the beginning of his reign, wrote they <I>unto him</I> an accusation against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem.

<DT><A NAME="4:8">4:8</A><DD>Rehum the chancellor and Shimshai the scribe wrote a letter against Jerusalem to Artaxerxes the king in this sort:

<DT><A NAME="4:11">4:11</A><DD>This <I>is</I> the copy of the letter that they sent unto him, <I>even</I> unto Artaxerxes the king; Thy servants the men on this side the river, and at such a time.
<DT><A NAME="4:12">4:12</A><DD>Be it known unto the king, that the Jews which came up from thee to us are come unto Jerusalem, building the rebellious and the bad city, and have set up the walls <I>thereof</I>, and joined the foundations.
<DT><A NAME="4:13">4:13</A><DD>Be it known now unto the king, that, if this city be builded, and the walls set up <I>again, then</I> will they not pay toll, tribute, and custom, and <I>so</I> thou shalt endamage the revenue of the kings.
<DT><A NAME="4:14">4:14</A><DD>Now because we have maintenance from <I>the king's</I> palace, and it was not meet for us to see the king's dishonour, therefore have we sent and certified the king;
<DT><A NAME="4:15">4:15</A><DD>That search may be made in the book of the records of thy fathers: so shalt thou find in the book of the records, and know that this city <I>is</I> a rebellious city, and hurtful unto kings and provinces, and that they have moved sedition within the same of old time: for which cause was this city destroyed.
<DT><A NAME="4:16">4:16</A><DD>We certify the king that, if this city be builded <I>again</I>, and the walls thereof set up, by this means thou shalt have no portion on this side the river.
<DT><A NAME="4:17">4:17</A><DD><I>Then</I> sent the king an answer unto Rehum the chancellor, and <I>to</I> Shimshai the scribe, and <I>to</I> the rest of their companions that dwell in Samaria, and <I>unto</I> the rest beyond the river, Peace, and at such a time.
<DT><A NAME="4:18">4:18</A><DD>The letter which ye sent unto us hath been plainly read before me.
<DT><A NAME="4:19">4:19</A><DD>And I commanded, and search hath been made, and it is found that this city of old time hath made insurrection against kings, and <I>that</I> rebellion and sedition have been made therein.
<DT><A NAME="4:20">4:20</A><DD>There have been mighty kings also over Jerusalem, which have ruled over all <I>countries</I> beyond the river; and toll, tribute, and custom, was paid unto them.
<DT><A NAME="4:21">4:21</A><DD>Give ye now commandment to cause these men to cease, and that this city be not builded, until <I>another</I> commandment shall be given from me.
<DT><A NAME="4:22">4:22</A><DD>Take heed now that ye fail not to do this: why should damage grow to the hurt of the kings?
<DT><A NAME="4:23">4:23</A><DD>Now when the copy of king Artaxerxes' letter <I>was</I> read before Rehum, and Shimshai the scribe, and their companions, they went up in haste to Jerusalem unto the Jews, and made them to cease by force and power.
<DT><A NAME="4:24">4:24</A><DD>Then ceased the work of the house of God which <I>is</I> at Jerusalem. So it ceased unto the second year of the reign of Darius king of Persia.

<DT><A NAME="10:13">10:13</A><DD>But the people <I>are</I> many, and <I>it is</I> a time of much rain, and we are not able to stand without, neither <I>is this</I> a work of one day or two: for we are many that have transgressed in this thing.
<DT><A NAME="10:14">10:14</A><DD>Let now our rulers of all the congregation stand, and let all them which have taken strange wives in our cities come at appointed times, and with them the elders of every city, and the judges thereof, until the fierce wrath of our God for this matter be turned from us.
