<DT><A NAME="1:1">1:1</A><DD>Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called <I>to be</I> an apostle, separated unto the gospel of God,
<DT><A NAME="1:2">1:2</A><DD>(Which he had promised afore by his prophets in the holy scriptures,)
<DT><A NAME="1:3">1:3</A><DD>Concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, which was made of the seed of David according to the flesh;
<DT><A NAME="1:4">1:4</A><DD>And declared <I>to be</I> the Son of God with power, according to the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead:
<DT><A NAME="1:5">1:5</A><DD>By whom we have received grace and apostleship, for obedience to the faith among all nations, for his name:
<DT><A NAME="1:6">1:6</A><DD>Among whom are ye also the called of Jesus Christ:
<DT><A NAME="1:7">1:7</A><DD>To all that be in Rome, beloved of God, called <I>to be</I> saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.
<DT><A NAME="1:8">1:8</A><DD>First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world.
<DT><A NAME="1:9">1:9</A><DD>For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers;
<DT><A NAME="1:10">1:10</A><DD>Making request, if by any means now at length I might have a prosperous journey by the will of God to come unto you.
<DT><A NAME="1:11">1:11</A><DD>For I long to see you, that I may impart unto you some spiritual gift, to the end ye may be established;
<DT><A NAME="1:12">1:12</A><DD>That is, that I may be comforted together with you by the mutual faith both of you and me.
<DT><A NAME="1:13">1:13</A><DD>Now I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that oftentimes I purposed to come unto you, (but was let hitherto,) that I might have some fruit among you also, even as among other Gentiles.
<DT><A NAME="1:14">1:14</A><DD>I am debtor both to the Greeks, and to the Barbarians; both to the wise, and to the unwise.
<DT><A NAME="1:15">1:15</A><DD>So, as much as in me is, I am ready to preach the gospel to you that are at Rome also.
<DT><A NAME="1:16">1:16</A><DD>For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.
<DT><A NAME="1:17">1:17</A><DD>For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith.
<DT><A NAME="1:18">1:18</A><DD>For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness;
<DT><A NAME="1:19">1:19</A><DD>Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God hath shewed <I>it</I> unto them.
<DT><A NAME="1:20">1:20</A><DD>For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, <I>even</I> his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse:
<DT><A NAME="1:21">1:21</A><DD>Because that, when they knew God, they glorified <I>him</I> not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.
<DT><A NAME="1:22">1:22</A><DD>Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools,
<DT><A NAME="1:23">1:23</A><DD>And changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and fourfooted beasts, and creeping things.
<DT><A NAME="1:24">1:24</A><DD>Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonour their own bodies between themselves:
<DT><A NAME="1:25">1:25</A><DD>Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen.
<DT><A NAME="1:26">1:26</A><DD>For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature:
<DT><A NAME="1:27">1:27</A><DD>And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet.
<DT><A NAME="1:28">1:28</A><DD>And even as they did not like to retain God in <I>their</I> knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient;
<DT><A NAME="1:29">1:29</A><DD>Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers,
<DT><A NAME="1:30">1:30</A><DD>Backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,
<DT><A NAME="1:31">1:31</A><DD>Without understanding, covenantbreakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful:
<DT><A NAME="1:32">1:32</A><DD>Who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them.
</DL></DIV><H2>Chapter 2</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="2:1">2:1</A><DD>Therefore thou art inexcusable, O man, whosoever thou art that judgest: for wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest thyself; for thou that judgest doest the same things.
<DT><A NAME="2:2">2:2</A><DD>But we are sure that the judgment of God is according to truth against them which commit such things.
<DT><A NAME="2:3">2:3</A><DD>And thinkest thou this, O man, that judgest them which do such things, and doest the same, that thou shalt escape the judgment of God?
<DT><A NAME="2:4">2:4</A><DD>Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance and longsuffering; not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance?
<DT><A NAME="2:5">2:5</A><DD>But after thy hardness and impenitent heart treasurest up unto thyself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God;
<DT><A NAME="2:6">2:6</A><DD>Who will render to every man according to his deeds:
<DT><A NAME="2:7">2:7</A><DD>To them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory and honour and immortality, eternal life:
<DT><A NAME="2:8">2:8</A><DD>But unto them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, indignation and wrath,
<DT><A NAME="2:9">2:9</A><DD>Tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of man that doeth evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Gentile;
<DT><A NAME="2:10">2:10</A><DD>But glory, honour, and peace, to every man that worketh good, to the Jew first, and also to the Gentile:
<DT><A NAME="2:11">2:11</A><DD>For there is no respect of persons with God.
<DT><A NAME="2:12">2:12</A><DD>For as many as have sinned without law shall also perish without law: and as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law;
<DT><A NAME="2:13">2:13</A><DD>(For not the hearers of the law <I>are</I> just before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified.
<DT><A NAME="2:14">2:14</A><DD>For when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law, these, having not the law, are a law unto themselves:
<DT><A NAME="2:15">2:15</A><DD>Which shew the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and <I>their</I> thoughts the mean while accusing or else excusing one another;)
<DT><A NAME="2:16">2:16</A><DD>In the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ according to my gospel.
<DT><A NAME="2:17">2:17</A><DD>Behold, thou art called a Jew, and restest in the law, and makest thy boast of God,
<DT><A NAME="2:18">2:18</A><DD>And knowest <I>his</I> will, and approvest the things that are more excellent, being instructed out of the law;
<DT><A NAME="2:19">2:19</A><DD>And art confident that thou thyself art a guide of the blind, a light of them which are in darkness,
<DT><A NAME="2:20">2:20</A><DD>An instructor of the foolish, a teacher of babes, which hast the form of knowledge and of the truth in the law.
<DT><A NAME="2:21">2:21</A><DD>Thou therefore which teachest another, teachest thou not thyself? thou that preachest a man should not steal, dost thou steal?
<DT><A NAME="2:22">2:22</A><DD>Thou that sayest a man should not commit adultery, dost thou commit adultery? thou that abhorrest idols, dost thou commit sacrilege?
<DT><A NAME="2:23">2:23</A><DD>Thou that makest thy boast of the law, through breaking the law dishonourest thou God?
<DT><A NAME="2:24">2:24</A><DD>For the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles through you, as it is written.
<DT><A NAME="2:25">2:25</A><DD>For circumcision verily profiteth, if thou keep the law: but if thou be a breaker of the law, thy circumcision is made uncircumcision.
<DT><A NAME="2:26">2:26</A><DD>Therefore if the uncircumcision keep the righteousness of the law, shall not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision?
<DT><A NAME="2:27">2:27</A><DD>And shall not uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfil the law, judge thee, who by the letter and circumcision dost transgress the law?
<DT><A NAME="2:28">2:28</A><DD>For he is not a Jew, which is one outwardly; neither <I>is that</I> circumcision, which is outward in the flesh:
<DT><A NAME="2:29">2:29</A><DD>But he <I>is</I> a Jew, which is one inwardly; and circumcision <I>is that</I> of the heart, in the spirit, <I>and</I> not in the letter; whose praise <I>is</I> not of men, but of God.
</DL></DIV><H2>Chapter 3</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="3:1">3:1</A><DD>What advantage then hath the Jew? or what profit <I>is there</I> of circumcision?
<DT><A NAME="3:2">3:2</A><DD>Much every way: chiefly, because that unto them were committed the oracles of God.
<DT><A NAME="3:3">3:3</A><DD>For what if some did not believe? shall their unbelief make the faith of God without effect?
<DT><A NAME="3:4">3:4</A><DD>God forbid: yea, let God be true, but every man a liar; as it is written, That thou mightest be justified in thy sayings, and mightest overcome when thou art judged.
<DT><A NAME="3:5">3:5</A><DD>But if our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of God, what shall we say? <I>Is</I> God unrighteous who taketh vengeance? (I speak as a man)
<DT><A NAME="3:6">3:6</A><DD>God forbid: for then how shall God judge the world?
<DT><A NAME="3:7">3:7</A><DD>For if the truth of God hath more abounded through my lie unto his glory; why yet am I also judged as a sinner?
<DT><A NAME="3:8">3:8</A><DD>And not <I>rather</I>, (as we be slanderously reported, and as some affirm that we say,) Let us do evil, that good may come? whose damnation is just.
<DT><A NAME="3:9">3:9</A><DD>What then? are we better <I>than they</I>? No, in no wise: for we have before proved both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all under sin;
<DT><A NAME="3:10">3:10</A><DD>As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:
<DT><A NAME="3:11">3:11</A><DD>There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God.
<DT><A NAME="3:12">3:12</A><DD>They are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable; there is none that doeth good, no, not one.
<DT><A NAME="3:13">3:13</A><DD>Their throat <I>is</I> an open sepulchre; with their tongues they have used deceit; the poison of asps <I>is</I> under their lips:
<DT><A NAME="3:14">3:14</A><DD>Whose mouth <I>is</I> full of cursing and bitterness:
<DT><A NAME="3:15">3:15</A><DD>Their feet <I>are</I> swift to shed blood:
<DT><A NAME="3:16">3:16</A><DD>Destruction and misery <I>are</I> in their ways:
<DT><A NAME="3:17">3:17</A><DD>And the way of peace have they not known:
<DT><A NAME="3:18">3:18</A><DD>There is no fear of God before their eyes.
<DT><A NAME="3:19">3:19</A><DD>Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it saith to them who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God.
<DT><A NAME="3:20">3:20</A><DD>Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law <I>is</I> the knowledge of sin.
<DT><A NAME="3:21">3:21</A><DD>But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets;
<DT><A NAME="3:22">3:22</A><DD>Even the righteousness of God <I>which is</I> by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is no difference:
<DT><A NAME="3:23">3:23</A><DD>For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;
<DT><A NAME="3:24">3:24</A><DD>Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus:
<DT><A NAME="3:25">3:25</A><DD>Whom God hath set forth <I>to be</I> a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God;
<DT><A NAME="3:26">3:26</A><DD>To declare, <I>I say</I>, at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus.
<DT><A NAME="3:27">3:27</A><DD>Where <I>is</I> boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works? Nay: but by the law of faith.
<DT><A NAME="3:28">3:28</A><DD>Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law.
<DT><A NAME="3:29">3:29</A><DD><I>Is he</I> the God of the Jews only? <I>is he</I> not also of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also:
<DT><A NAME="3:30">3:30</A><DD>Seeing <I>it is</I> one God, which shall justify the circumcision by faith, and uncircumcision through faith.
<DT><A NAME="3:31">3:31</A><DD>Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law.
</DL></DIV><H2>Chapter 4</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="4:1">4:1</A><DD>What shall we say then that Abraham our father, as pertaining to the flesh, hath found?
<DT><A NAME="4:2">4:2</A><DD>For if Abraham were justified by works, he hath <I>whereof</I> to glory; but not before God.
<DT><A NAME="4:3">4:3</A><DD>For what saith the scripture? Abraham believed God, and it was counted unto him for righteousness.
<DT><A NAME="4:4">4:4</A><DD>Now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt.
<DT><A NAME="4:5">4:5</A><DD>But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness.
<DT><A NAME="4:6">4:6</A><DD>Even as David also describeth the blessedness of the man, unto whom God imputeth righteousness without works,
<DT><A NAME="4:7">4:7</A><DD><I>Saying</I>, Blessed <I>are</I> they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered.
<DT><A NAME="4:8">4:8</A><DD>Blessed <I>is</I> the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin.
<DT><A NAME="4:9">4:9</A><DD><I>Cometh</I> this blessedness then upon the circumcision <I>only</I>, or upon the uncircumcision also? for we say that faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness.
<DT><A NAME="4:10">4:10</A><DD>How was it then reckoned? when he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.
<DT><A NAME="4:11">4:11</A><DD>And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which <I>he had yet</I> being uncircumcised: that he might be the father of all them that believe, though they be not circumcised; that righteousness might be imputed unto them also:
<DT><A NAME="4:12">4:12</A><DD>And the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only, but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham, which <I>he had</I> being <I>yet</I> uncircumcised.
<DT><A NAME="4:13">4:13</A><DD>For the promise, that he should be the heir of the world, <I>was</I> not to Abraham, or to his seed, through the law, but through the righteousness of faith.
<DT><A NAME="4:14">4:14</A><DD>For if they which are of the law <I>be</I> heirs, faith is made void, and the promise made of none effect:
<DT><A NAME="4:15">4:15</A><DD>Because the law worketh wrath: for where no law is, <I>there is</I> no transgression.
<DT><A NAME="4:16">4:16</A><DD>Therefore <I>it is</I> of faith, that <I>it might be</I> by grace; to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed; not to that only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham; who is the father of us all,
<DT><A NAME="4:17">4:17</A><DD>(As it is written, I have made thee a father of many nations,) before him whom he believed, <I>even</I> God, who quickeneth the dead, and calleth those things which be not as though they were.
<DT><A NAME="4:18">4:18</A><DD>Who against hope believed in hope, that he might become the father of many nations, according to that which was spoken, So shall thy seed be.
<DT><A NAME="4:19">4:19</A><DD>And being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body now dead, when he was about an hundred years old, neither yet the deadness of Sara's womb:
<DT><A NAME="4:20">4:20</A><DD>He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving glory to God;
<DT><A NAME="4:21">4:21</A><DD>And being fully persuaded that, what he had promised, he was able also to perform.
<DT><A NAME="4:22">4:22</A><DD>And therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness.
<DT><A NAME="4:23">4:23</A><DD>Now it was not written for his sake alone, that it was imputed to him;
<DT><A NAME="4:24">4:24</A><DD>But for us also, to whom it shall be imputed, if we believe on him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead;
<DT><A NAME="4:25">4:25</A><DD>Who was delivered for our offences, and was raised again for our justification.
</DL></DIV><H2>Chapter 5</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="5:1">5:1</A><DD>Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ:
<DT><A NAME="5:2">5:2</A><DD>By whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God.
<DT><A NAME="5:3">5:3</A><DD>And not only <I>so</I>, but we glory in tribulations also: knowing that tribulation worketh patience;
<DT><A NAME="5:4">5:4</A><DD>And patience, experience; and experience, hope:
<DT><A NAME="5:5">5:5</A><DD>And hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us.
<DT><A NAME="5:6">5:6</A><DD>For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly.
<DT><A NAME="5:7">5:7</A><DD>For scarcely for a righteous man will one die: yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die.
<DT><A NAME="5:8">5:8</A><DD>But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.
<DT><A NAME="5:9">5:9</A><DD>Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him.
<DT><A NAME="5:10">5:10</A><DD>For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life.
<DT><A NAME="5:11">5:11</A><DD>And not only <I>so</I>, but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the atonement.
<DT><A NAME="5:12">5:12</A><DD>Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned:
<DT><A NAME="5:13">5:13</A><DD>(For until the law sin was in the world: but sin is not imputed when there is no law.
<DT><A NAME="5:14">5:14</A><DD>Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression, who is the figure of him that was to come.

<DT><A NAME="5:16">5:16</A><DD>And not as <I>it was</I> by one that sinned, <I>so is</I> the gift: for the judgment <I>was</I> by one to condemnation, but the free gift <I>is</I> of many offences unto justification.

<DT><A NAME="6:3">6:3</A><DD>Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death?
<DT><A NAME="6:4">6:4</A><DD>Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.

<DT><A NAME="6:18">6:18</A><DD>Being then made free from sin, ye became the servants of righteousness.
<DT><A NAME="6:19">6:19</A><DD>I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh: for as ye have yielded your members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity; even so now yield your members servants to righteousness unto holiness.

<DT><A NAME="7:2">7:2</A><DD>For the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to <I>her</I> husband so long as he liveth; but if the husband be dead, she is loosed from the law of <I>her</I> husband.
<DT><A NAME="7:3">7:3</A><DD>So then if, while <I>her</I> husband liveth, she be married to another man, she shall be called an adulteress: but if her husband be dead, she is free from that law; so that she is no adulteress, though she be married to another man.
<DT><A NAME="7:4">7:4</A><DD>Wherefore, my brethren, ye also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ; that ye should be married to another, <I>even</I> to him who is raised from the dead, that we should bring forth fruit unto God.
<DT><A NAME="7:5">7:5</A><DD>For when we were in the flesh, the motions of sins, which were by the law, did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death.
<DT><A NAME="7:6">7:6</A><DD>But now we are delivered from the law, that being dead wherein we were held; that we should serve in newness of spirit, and not <I>in</I> the oldness of the letter.
<DT><A NAME="7:7">7:7</A><DD>What shall we say then? <I>Is</I> the law sin? God forbid. Nay, I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet.
<DT><A NAME="7:8">7:8</A><DD>But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner of concupiscence. For without the law sin <I>was</I> dead.

<DT><A NAME="7:13">7:13</A><DD>Was then that which is good made death unto me? God forbid. But sin, that it might appear sin, working death in me by that which is good; that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful.
<DT><A NAME="7:14">7:14</A><DD>For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin.
<DT><A NAME="7:15">7:15</A><DD>For that which I do I allow not: for what I would, that do I not; but what I hate, that do I.

<DT><A NAME="7:17">7:17</A><DD>Now then it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.
<DT><A NAME="7:18">7:18</A><DD>For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good thing: for to will is present with me; but <I>how</I> to perform that which is good I find not.

<DT><A NAME="7:21">7:21</A><DD>I find then a law, that, when I would do good, evil is present with me.
<DT><A NAME="7:22">7:22</A><DD>For I delight in the law of God after the inward man:
<DT><A NAME="7:23">7:23</A><DD>But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members.
<DT><A NAME="7:24">7:24</A><DD>O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?

<DT><A NAME="8:3">8:3</A><DD>For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh:
<DT><A NAME="8:4">8:4</A><DD>That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.

<DT><A NAME="8:6">8:6</A><DD>For to be carnally minded <I>is</I> death; but to be spiritually minded <I>is</I> life and peace.
<DT><A NAME="8:7">8:7</A><DD>Because the carnal mind <I>is</I> enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.
<DT><A NAME="8:8">8:8</A><DD>So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God.
<DT><A NAME="8:9">8:9</A><DD>But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.

<DT><A NAME="8:16">8:16</A><DD>The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God:
<DT><A NAME="8:17">8:17</A><DD>And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with <I>him</I>, that we may be also glorified together.

<DT><A NAME="8:19">8:19</A><DD>For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God.
<DT><A NAME="8:20">8:20</A><DD>For the creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him who hath subjected <I>the same</I> in hope,
<DT><A NAME="8:21">8:21</A><DD>Because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God.
<DT><A NAME="8:22">8:22</A><DD>For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now.

<DT><A NAME="8:24">8:24</A><DD>For we are saved by hope: but hope that is seen is not hope: for what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for?
<DT><A NAME="8:25">8:25</A><DD>But if we hope for that we see not, <I>then</I> do we with patience wait for <I>it</I>.
<DT><A NAME="8:26">8:26</A><DD>Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.

<DT><A NAME="11:8">11:8</A><DD>(According as it is written, God hath given them the spirit of slumber, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear;) unto this day.

<DT><A NAME="11:32">11:32</A><DD>For God hath concluded them all in unbelief, that he might have mercy upon all.
