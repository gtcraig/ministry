<H2>Chapter 1</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="1:1">1:1</A><DD>Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth <I>month</I>, in the fifth <I>day</I> of the month, as I <I>was</I> among the captives by the river of Chebar, <I>that</I> the heavens were opened, and I saw visions of God.
<DT><A NAME="1:2">1:2</A><DD>In the fifth <I>day</I> of the month, which <I>was</I> the fifth year of king Jehoiachin's captivity,
<DT><A NAME="1:3">1:3</A><DD>The word of the LORD came expressly unto Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans by the river Chebar; and the hand of the LORD was there upon him.
<DT><A NAME="1:4">1:4</A><DD>And I looked, and, behold, a whirlwind came out of the north, a great cloud, and a fire infolding itself, and a brightness <I>was</I> about it, and out of the midst thereof as the colour of amber, out of the midst of the fire.
<DT><A NAME="1:5">1:5</A><DD>Also out of the midst thereof <I>came</I> the likeness of four living creatures. And this <I>was</I> their appearance; they had the likeness of a man.
<DT><A NAME="1:6">1:6</A><DD>And every one had four faces, and every one had four wings.
<DT><A NAME="1:7">1:7</A><DD>And their feet <I>were</I> straight feet; and the sole of their feet <I>was</I> like the sole of a calf's foot: and they sparkled like the colour of burnished brass.
<DT><A NAME="1:8">1:8</A><DD>And <I>they had</I> the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides; and they four had their faces and their wings.
<DT><A NAME="1:9">1:9</A><DD>Their wings <I>were</I> joined one to another; they turned not when they went; they went every one straight forward.
<DT><A NAME="1:10">1:10</A><DD>As for the likeness of their faces, they four had the face of a man, and the face of a lion, on the right side: and they four had the face of an ox on the left side; they four also had the face of an eagle.
<DT><A NAME="1:11">1:11</A><DD>Thus <I>were</I> their faces: and their wings <I>were</I> stretched upward; two <I>wings</I> of every one <I>were</I> joined one to another, and two covered their bodies.
<DT><A NAME="1:12">1:12</A><DD>And they went every one straight forward: whither the spirit was to go, they went; <I>and</I> they turned not when they went.
<DT><A NAME="1:13">1:13</A><DD>As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance <I>was</I> like burning coals of fire, <I>and</I> like the appearance of lamps: it went up and down among the living creatures; and the fire was bright, and out of the fire went forth lightning.
<DT><A NAME="1:14">1:14</A><DD>And the living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a flash of lightning.
<DT><A NAME="1:15">1:15</A><DD>Now as I beheld the living creatures, behold one wheel upon the earth by the living creatures, with his four faces.
<DT><A NAME="1:16">1:16</A><DD>The appearance of the wheels and their work <I>was</I> like unto the colour of a beryl: and they four had one likeness: and their appearance and their work <I>was</I> as it were a wheel in the middle of a wheel.
<DT><A NAME="1:17">1:17</A><DD>When they went, they went upon their four sides: <I>and</I> they turned not when they went.
<DT><A NAME="1:18">1:18</A><DD>As for their rings, they were so high that they were dreadful; and their rings <I>were</I> full of eyes round about them four.
<DT><A NAME="1:19">1:19</A><DD>And when the living creatures went, the wheels went by them: and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up.
<DT><A NAME="1:20">1:20</A><DD>Whithersoever the spirit was to go, they went, thither <I>was their</I> spirit to go; and the wheels were lifted up over against them: for the spirit of the living creature <I>was</I> in the wheels.
<DT><A NAME="1:21">1:21</A><DD>When those went, <I>these</I> went; and when those stood, <I>these</I> stood; and when those were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up over against them: for the spirit of the living creature <I>was</I> in the wheels.
<DT><A NAME="1:22">1:22</A><DD>And the likeness of the firmament upon the heads of the living creature <I>was</I> as the colour of the terrible crystal, stretched forth over their heads above.
<DT><A NAME="1:23">1:23</A><DD>And under the firmament <I>were</I> their wings straight, the one toward the other: every one had two, which covered on this side, and every one had two, which covered on that side, their bodies.
<DT><A NAME="1:24">1:24</A><DD>And when they went, I heard the noise of their wings, like the noise of great waters, as the voice of the Almighty, the voice of speech, as the noise of an host: when they stood, they let down their wings.
<DT><A NAME="1:25">1:25</A><DD>And there was a voice from the firmament that <I>was</I> over their heads, when they stood, <I>and</I> had let down their wings.
<DT><A NAME="1:26">1:26</A><DD>And above the firmament that <I>was</I> over their heads <I>was</I> the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone: and upon the likeness of the throne <I>was</I> the likeness as the appearance of a man above upon it.
<DT><A NAME="1:27">1:27</A><DD>And I saw as the colour of amber, as the appearance of fire round about within it, from the appearance of his loins even upward, and from the appearance of his loins even downward, I saw as it were the appearance of fire, and it had brightness round about.
<DT><A NAME="1:28">1:28</A><DD>As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so <I>was</I> the appearance of the brightness round about. This <I>was</I> the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the LORD. And when I saw <I>it</I>, I fell upon my face, and I heard a voice of one that spake.
</DL></DIV><H2>Chapter 2</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="2:1">2:1</A><DD>And he said unto me, Son of man, stand upon thy feet, and I will speak unto thee.
<DT><A NAME="2:2">2:2</A><DD>And the spirit entered into me when he spake unto me, and set me upon my feet, that I heard him that spake unto me.
<DT><A NAME="2:3">2:3</A><DD>And he said unto me, Son of man, I send thee to the children of Israel, to a rebellious nation that hath rebelled against me: they and their fathers have transgressed against me, <I>even</I> unto this very day.
<DT><A NAME="2:4">2:4</A><DD>For <I>they are</I> impudent children and stiffhearted. I do send thee unto them; and thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD.
<DT><A NAME="2:5">2:5</A><DD>And they, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear, (for they <I>are</I> a rebellious house,) yet shall know that there hath been a prophet among them.
<DT><A NAME="2:6">2:6</A><DD>And thou, son of man, be not afraid of them, neither be afraid of their words, though briers and thorns <I>be</I> with thee, and thou dost dwell among scorpions: be not afraid of their words, nor be dismayed at their looks, though they <I>be</I> a rebellious house.
<DT><A NAME="2:7">2:7</A><DD>And thou shalt speak my words unto them, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear: for they <I>are</I> most rebellious.
<DT><A NAME="2:8">2:8</A><DD>But thou, son of man, hear what I say unto thee; Be not thou rebellious like that rebellious house: open thy mouth, and eat that I give thee.
<DT><A NAME="2:9">2:9</A><DD>And when I looked, behold, an hand <I>was</I> sent unto me; and, lo, a roll of a book <I>was</I> therein;
<DT><A NAME="2:10">2:10</A><DD>And he spread it before me; and it <I>was</I> written within and without: and <I>there was</I> written therein lamentations, and mourning, and woe.
</DL></DIV><H2>Chapter 3</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="3:1">3:1</A><DD>Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, eat that thou findest; eat this roll, and go speak unto the house of Israel.
<DT><A NAME="3:2">3:2</A><DD>So I opened my mouth, and he caused me to eat that roll.
<DT><A NAME="3:3">3:3</A><DD>And he said unto me, Son of man, cause thy belly to eat, and fill thy bowels with this roll that I give thee. Then did I eat <I>it</I>; and it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness.
<DT><A NAME="3:4">3:4</A><DD>And he said unto me, Son of man, go, get thee unto the house of Israel, and speak with my words unto them.
<DT><A NAME="3:5">3:5</A><DD>For thou <I>art</I> not sent to a people of a strange speech and of an hard language, <I>but</I> to the house of Israel;
<DT><A NAME="3:6">3:6</A><DD>Not to many people of a strange speech and of an hard language, whose words thou canst not understand. Surely, had I sent thee to them, they would have hearkened unto thee.
<DT><A NAME="3:7">3:7</A><DD>But the house of Israel will not hearken unto thee; for they will not hearken unto me: for all the house of Israel <I>are</I> impudent and hardhearted.
<DT><A NAME="3:8">3:8</A><DD>Behold, I have made thy face strong against their faces, and thy forehead strong against their foreheads.
<DT><A NAME="3:9">3:9</A><DD>As an adamant harder than flint have I made thy forehead: fear them not, neither be dismayed at their looks, though they <I>be</I> a rebellious house.
<DT><A NAME="3:10">3:10</A><DD>Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, all my words that I shall speak unto thee receive in thine heart, and hear with thine ears.
<DT><A NAME="3:11">3:11</A><DD>And go, get thee to them of the captivity, unto the children of thy people, and speak unto them, and tell them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear.
<DT><A NAME="3:12">3:12</A><DD>Then the spirit took me up, and I heard behind me a voice of a great rushing, <I>saying</I>, Blessed <I>be</I> the glory of the LORD from his place.
<DT><A NAME="3:13">3:13</A><DD><I>I heard</I> also the noise of the wings of the living creatures that touched one another, and the noise of the wheels over against them, and a noise of a great rushing.
<DT><A NAME="3:14">3:14</A><DD>So the spirit lifted me up, and took me away, and I went in bitterness, in the heat of my spirit; but the hand of the LORD was strong upon me.
<DT><A NAME="3:15">3:15</A><DD>Then I came to them of the captivity at Telabib, that dwelt by the river of Chebar, and I sat where they sat, and remained there astonished among them seven days.
<DT><A NAME="3:16">3:16</A><DD>And it came to pass at the end of seven days, that the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,
<DT><A NAME="3:17">3:17</A><DD>Son of man, I have made thee a watchman unto the house of Israel: therefore hear the word at my mouth, and give them warning from me.
<DT><A NAME="3:18">3:18</A><DD>When I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; and thou givest him not warning, nor speakest to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life; the same wicked <I>man</I> shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thine hand.
<DT><A NAME="3:19">3:19</A><DD>Yet if thou warn the wicked, and he turn not from his wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul.
<DT><A NAME="3:20">3:20</A><DD>Again, When a righteous <I>man</I> doth turn from his righteousness, and commit iniquity, and I lay a stumblingblock before him, he shall die: because thou hast not given him warning, he shall die in his sin, and his righteousness which he hath done shall not be remembered; but his blood will I require at thine hand.
<DT><A NAME="3:21">3:21</A><DD>Nevertheless if thou warn the righteous <I>man</I>, that the righteous sin not, and he doth not sin, he shall surely live, because he is warned; also thou hast delivered thy soul.
<DT><A NAME="3:22">3:22</A><DD>And the hand of the LORD was there upon me; and he said unto me, Arise, go forth into the plain, and I will there talk with thee.
<DT><A NAME="3:23">3:23</A><DD>Then I arose, and went forth into the plain: and, behold, the glory of the LORD stood there, as the glory which I saw by the river of Chebar: and I fell on my face.
<DT><A NAME="3:24">3:24</A><DD>Then the spirit entered into me, and set me upon my feet, and spake with me, and said unto me, Go, shut thyself within thine house.
<DT><A NAME="3:25">3:25</A><DD>But thou, O son of man, behold, they shall put bands upon thee, and shall bind thee with them, and thou shalt not go out among them:
<DT><A NAME="3:26">3:26</A><DD>And I will make thy tongue cleave to the roof of thy mouth, that thou shalt be dumb, and shalt not be to them a reprover: for they <I>are</I> a rebellious house.
<DT><A NAME="3:27">3:27</A><DD>But when I speak with thee, I will open thy mouth, and thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; He that heareth, let him hear; and he that forbeareth, let him forbear: for they <I>are</I> a rebellious house.
</DL></DIV><H2>Chapter 4</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="4:1">4:1</A><DD>Thou also, son of man, take thee a tile, and lay it before thee, and pourtray upon it the city, <I>even</I> Jerusalem:
<DT><A NAME="4:2">4:2</A><DD>And lay siege against it, and build a fort against it, and cast a mount against it; set the camp also against it, and set <I>battering</I> rams against it round about.
<DT><A NAME="4:3">4:3</A><DD>Moreover take thou unto thee an iron pan, and set it <I>for</I> a wall of iron between thee and the city: and set thy face against it, and it shall be besieged, and thou shalt lay siege against it. This <I>shall be</I> a sign to the house of Israel.
<DT><A NAME="4:4">4:4</A><DD>Lie thou also upon thy left side, and lay the iniquity of the house of Israel upon it: <I>according</I> to the number of the days that thou shalt lie upon it thou shalt bear their iniquity.
<DT><A NAME="4:5">4:5</A><DD>For I have laid upon thee the years of their iniquity, according to the number of the days, three hundred and ninety days: so shalt thou bear the iniquity of the house of Israel.
<DT><A NAME="4:6">4:6</A><DD>And when thou hast accomplished them, lie again on thy right side, and thou shalt bear the iniquity of the house of Judah forty days: I have appointed thee each day for a year.
<DT><A NAME="4:7">4:7</A><DD>Therefore thou shalt set thy face toward the siege of Jerusalem, and thine arm <I>shall be</I> uncovered, and thou shalt prophesy against it.
<DT><A NAME="4:8">4:8</A><DD>And, behold, I will lay bands upon thee, and thou shalt not turn thee from one side to another, till thou hast ended the days of thy siege.
<DT><A NAME="4:9">4:9</A><DD>Take thou also unto thee wheat, and barley, and beans, and lentiles, and millet, and fitches, and put them in one vessel, and make thee bread thereof, <I>according</I> to the number of the days that thou shalt lie upon thy side, three hundred and ninety days shalt thou eat thereof.
<DT><A NAME="4:10">4:10</A><DD>And thy meat which thou shalt eat <I>shall be</I> by weight, twenty shekels a day: from time to time shalt thou eat it.
<DT><A NAME="4:11">4:11</A><DD>Thou shalt drink also water by measure, the sixth part of an hin: from time to time shalt thou drink.
<DT><A NAME="4:12">4:12</A><DD>And thou shalt eat it <I>as</I> barley cakes, and thou shalt bake it with dung that cometh out of man, in their sight.
<DT><A NAME="4:13">4:13</A><DD>And the LORD said, Even thus shall the children of Israel eat their defiled bread among the Gentiles, whither I will drive them.
<DT><A NAME="4:14">4:14</A><DD>Then said I, Ah Lord GOD! behold, my soul hath not been polluted: for from my youth up even till now have I not eaten of that which dieth of itself, or is torn in pieces; neither came there abominable flesh into my mouth.
<DT><A NAME="4:15">4:15</A><DD>Then he said unto me, Lo, I have given thee cow's dung for man's dung, and thou shalt prepare thy bread therewith.
<DT><A NAME="4:16">4:16</A><DD>Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, behold, I will break the staff of bread in Jerusalem: and they shall eat bread by weight, and with care; and they shall drink water by measure, and with astonishment:
<DT><A NAME="4:17">4:17</A><DD>That they may want bread and water, and be astonied one with another, and consume away for their iniquity.
</DL></DIV><H2>Chapter 5</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="5:1">5:1</A><DD>And thou, son of man, take thee a sharp knife, take thee a barber's razor, and cause <I>it</I> to pass upon thine head and upon thy beard: then take thee balances to weigh, and divide the <I>hair</I>.
<DT><A NAME="5:2">5:2</A><DD>Thou shalt burn with fire a third part in the midst of the city, when the days of the siege are fulfilled: and thou shalt take a third part, <I>and</I> smite about it with a knife: and a third part thou shalt scatter in the wind; and I will draw out a sword after them.
<DT><A NAME="5:3">5:3</A><DD>Thou shalt also take thereof a few in number, and bind them in thy skirts.
<DT><A NAME="5:4">5:4</A><DD>Then take of them again, and cast them into the midst of the fire, and burn them in the fire; <I>for</I> thereof shall a fire come forth into all the house of Israel.
<DT><A NAME="5:5">5:5</A><DD>Thus saith the Lord GOD; This <I>is</I> Jerusalem: I have set it in the midst of the nations and countries <I>that are</I> round about her.
<DT><A NAME="5:6">5:6</A><DD>And she hath changed my judgments into wickedness more than the nations, and my statutes more than the countries that <I>are</I> round about her: for they have refused my judgments and my statutes, they have not walked in them.
<DT><A NAME="5:7">5:7</A><DD>Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because ye multiplied more than the nations that <I>are</I> round about you, <I>and</I> have not walked in my statutes, neither have kept my judgments, neither have done according to the judgments of the nations that <I>are</I> round about you;
<DT><A NAME="5:8">5:8</A><DD>Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I, even I, <I>am</I> against thee, and will execute judgments in the midst of thee in the sight of the nations.
<DT><A NAME="5:9">5:9</A><DD>And I will do in thee that which I have not done, and whereunto I will not do any more the like, because of all thine abominations.
<DT><A NAME="5:10">5:10</A><DD>Therefore the fathers shall eat the sons in the midst of thee, and the sons shall eat their fathers; and I will execute judgments in thee, and the whole remnant of thee will I scatter into all the winds.
<DT><A NAME="5:11">5:11</A><DD>Wherefore, <I>as</I> I live, saith the Lord GOD; Surely, because thou hast defiled my sanctuary with all thy detestable things, and with all thine abominations, therefore will I also diminish <I>thee</I>; neither shall mine eye spare, neither will I have any pity.

<DT><A NAME="12:2">12:2</A><DD>Son of man, thou dwellest in the midst of a rebellious house, which have eyes to see, and see not; they have ears to hear, and hear not: for they <I>are</I> a rebellious house.
<DT><A NAME="12:3">12:3</A><DD>Therefore, thou son of man, prepare thee stuff for removing, and remove by day in their sight; and thou shalt remove from thy place to another place in their sight: it may be they will consider, though they <I>be</I> a rebellious house.
<DT><A NAME="12:4">12:4</A><DD>Then shalt thou bring forth thy stuff by day in their sight, as stuff for removing: and thou shalt go forth at even in their sight, as they that go forth into captivity.
<DT><A NAME="12:5">12:5</A><DD>Dig thou through the wall in their sight, and carry out thereby.
<DT><A NAME="12:6">12:6</A><DD>In their sight shalt thou bear <I>it</I> upon <I>thy</I> shoulders, <I>and</I> carry <I>it</I> forth in the twilight: thou shalt cover thy face, that thou see not the ground: for I have set thee <I>for</I> a sign unto the house of Israel.
<DT><A NAME="12:7">12:7</A><DD>And I did so as I was commanded: I brought forth my stuff by day, as stuff for captivity, and in the even I digged through the wall with mine hand; I brought <I>it</I> forth in the twilight, <I>and</I> I bare <I>it</I> upon <I>my</I> shoulder in their sight.
<DT><A NAME="12:8">12:8</A><DD>And in the morning came the word of the LORD unto me, saying,
<DT><A NAME="12:9">12:9</A><DD>Son of man, hath not the house of Israel, the rebellious house, said unto thee, What doest thou?
<DT><A NAME="12:10">12:10</A><DD>Say thou unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; This burden <I>concerneth</I> the prince in Jerusalem, and all the house of Israel that <I>are</I> among them.
<DT><A NAME="12:11">12:11</A><DD>Say, I <I>am</I> your sign: like as I have done, so shall it be done unto them: they shall remove <I>and</I> go into captivity.
<DT><A NAME="12:12">12:12</A><DD>And the prince that <I>is</I> among them shall bear upon <I>his</I> shoulder in the twilight, and shall go forth: they shall dig through the wall to carry out thereby: he shall cover his face, that he see not the ground with <I>his</I> eyes.
<DT><A NAME="12:13">12:13</A><DD>My net also will I spread upon him, and he shall be taken in my snare: and I will bring him to Babylon <I>to</I> the land of the Chaldeans; yet shall he not see it, though he shall die there.
<DT><A NAME="12:14">12:14</A><DD>And I will scatter toward every wind all that <I>are</I> about him to help him, and all his bands; and I will draw out the sword after them.
<DT><A NAME="12:15">12:15</A><DD>And they shall know that I <I>am</I> the LORD, when I shall scatter them among the nations, and disperse them in the countries.
<DT><A NAME="12:16">12:16</A><DD>But I will leave a few men of them from the sword, from the famine, and from the pestilence; that they may declare all their abominations among the heathen whither they come; and they shall know that I <I>am</I> the LORD.
<DT><A NAME="12:17">12:17</A><DD>Moreover the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
<DT><A NAME="12:18">12:18</A><DD>Son of man, eat thy bread with quaking, and drink thy water with trembling and with carefulness;
<DT><A NAME="12:19">12:19</A><DD>And say unto the people of the land, Thus saith the Lord GOD of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, <I>and</I> of the land of Israel; They shall eat their bread with carefulness, and drink their water with astonishment, that her land may be desolate from all that is therein, because of the violence of all them that dwell therein.
<DT><A NAME="12:20">12:20</A><DD>And the cities that are inhabited shall be laid waste, and the land shall be desolate; and ye shall know that I <I>am</I> the LORD.
<DT><A NAME="12:21">12:21</A><DD>And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,
<DT><A NAME="12:22">12:22</A><DD>Son of man, what <I>is</I> that proverb <I>that</I> ye have in the land of Israel, saying, The days are prolonged, and every vision faileth?
<DT><A NAME="12:23">12:23</A><DD>Tell them therefore, Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will make this proverb to cease, and they shall no more use it as a proverb in Israel; but say unto them, The days are at hand, and the effect of every vision.
<DT><A NAME="12:24">12:24</A><DD>For there shall be no more any vain vision nor flattering divination within the house of Israel.
<DT><A NAME="12:25">12:25</A><DD>For I <I>am</I> the LORD: I will speak, and the word that I shall speak shall come to pass; it shall be no more prolonged: for in your days, O rebellious house, will I say the word, and will perform it, saith the Lord GOD.
<DT><A NAME="12:26">12:26</A><DD>Again the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
<DT><A NAME="12:27">12:27</A><DD>Son of man, behold, <I>they of</I> the house of Israel say, The vision that he seeth <I>is</I> for many days <I>to come</I>, and he prophesieth of the times <I>that are</I> far off.
<DT><A NAME="12:28">12:28</A><DD>Therefore say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; There shall none of my words be prolonged any more, but the word which I have spoken shall be done, saith the Lord GOD.

<DT><A NAME="13:1">13:1</A><DD>And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,
<DT><A NAME="13:2">13:2</A><DD>Son of man, prophesy against the prophets of Israel that prophesy, and say thou unto them that prophesy out of their own hearts, Hear ye the word of the LORD;
<DT><A NAME="13:3">13:3</A><DD>Thus saith the Lord GOD; Woe unto the foolish prophets, that follow their own spirit, and have seen nothing!
<DT><A NAME="13:4">13:4</A><DD>O Israel, thy prophets are like the foxes in the deserts.
<DT><A NAME="13:5">13:5</A><DD>Ye have not gone up into the gaps, neither made up the hedge for the house of Israel to stand in the battle in the day of the LORD.
<DT><A NAME="13:6">13:6</A><DD>They have seen vanity and lying divination, saying, The LORD saith: and the LORD hath not sent them: and they have made <I>others</I> to hope that they would confirm the word.
<DT><A NAME="13:7">13:7</A><DD>Have ye not seen a vain vision, and have ye not spoken a lying divination, whereas ye say, The LORD saith <I>it</I>; albeit I have not spoken?
<DT><A NAME="13:8">13:8</A><DD>Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because ye have spoken vanity, and seen lies, therefore, behold, I <I>am</I> against you, saith the Lord GOD.
<DT><A NAME="13:9">13:9</A><DD>And mine hand shall be upon the prophets that see vanity, and that divine lies: they shall not be in the assembly of my people, neither shall they be written in the writing of the house of Israel, neither shall they enter into the land of Israel; and ye shall know that I <I>am</I> the Lord GOD.
<DT><A NAME="13:10">13:10</A><DD>Because, even because they have seduced my people, saying, Peace; and <I>there was</I> no peace; and one built up a wall, and, lo, others daubed it with untempered <I>morter</I>:
<DT><A NAME="13:11">13:11</A><DD>Say unto them which daub <I>it</I> with untempered <I>morter</I>, that it shall fall: there shall be an overflowing shower; and ye, O great hailstones, shall fall; and a stormy wind shall rend <I>it</I>.
<DT><A NAME="13:12">13:12</A><DD>Lo, when the wall is fallen, shall it not be said unto you, Where <I>is</I> the daubing wherewith ye have daubed <I>it</I>?
<DT><A NAME="13:13">13:13</A><DD>Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; I will even rend <I>it</I> with a stormy wind in my fury; and there shall be an overflowing shower in mine anger, and great hailstones in <I>my</I> fury to consume <I>it</I>.
<DT><A NAME="13:14">13:14</A><DD>So will I break down the wall that ye have daubed with untempered <I>morter</I>, and bring it down to the ground, so that the foundation thereof shall be discovered, and it shall fall, and ye shall be consumed in the midst thereof: and ye shall know that I <I>am</I> the LORD.
<DT><A NAME="13:15">13:15</A><DD>Thus will I accomplish my wrath upon the wall, and upon them that have daubed it with untempered <I>morter</I>, and will say unto you, The wall <I>is</I> no <I>more</I>, neither they that daubed it;
<DT><A NAME="13:16">13:16</A><DD><I>To wit</I>, the prophets of Israel which prophesy concerning Jerusalem, and which see visions of peace for her, and <I>there is</I> no peace, saith the Lord GOD.
<DT><A NAME="13:17">13:17</A><DD>Likewise, thou son of man, set thy face against the daughters of thy people, which prophesy out of their own heart; and prophesy thou against them,
<DT><A NAME="13:18">13:18</A><DD>And say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Woe to the <I>women</I> that sew pillows to all armholes, and make kerchiefs upon the head of every stature to hunt souls! Will ye hunt the souls of my people, and will ye save the souls alive <I>that come</I> unto you?
<DT><A NAME="13:19">13:19</A><DD>And will ye pollute me among my people for handfuls of barley and for pieces of bread, to slay the souls that should not die, and to save the souls alive that should not live, by your lying to my people that hear <I>your</I> lies?
<DT><A NAME="13:20">13:20</A><DD>Wherefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I <I>am</I> against your pillows, wherewith ye there hunt the souls to make <I>them</I> fly, and I will tear them from your arms, and will let the souls go, <I>even</I> the souls that ye hunt to make <I>them</I> fly.
<DT><A NAME="13:21">13:21</A><DD>Your kerchiefs also will I tear, and deliver my people out of your hand, and they shall be no more in your hand to be hunted; and ye shall know that I <I>am</I> the LORD.
<DT><A NAME="13:22">13:22</A><DD>Because with lies ye have made the heart of the righteous sad, whom I have not made sad; and strengthened the hands of the wicked, that he should not return from his wicked way, by promising him life:
<DT><A NAME="13:23">13:23</A><DD>Therefore ye shall see no more vanity, nor divine divinations: for I will deliver my people out of your hand: and ye shall know that I <I>am</I> the LORD.

<DT><A NAME="14:1">14:1</A><DD>Then came certain of the elders of Israel unto me, and sat before me.
<DT><A NAME="14:2">14:2</A><DD>And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,
<DT><A NAME="14:3">14:3</A><DD>Son of man, these men have set up their idols in their heart, and put the stumblingblock of their iniquity before their face: should I be enquired of at all by them?
<DT><A NAME="14:4">14:4</A><DD>Therefore speak unto them, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Every man of the house of Israel that setteth up his idols in his heart, and putteth the stumblingblock of his iniquity before his face, and cometh to the prophet; I the LORD will answer him that cometh according to the multitude of his idols;
<DT><A NAME="14:5">14:5</A><DD>That I may take the house of Israel in their own heart, because they are all estranged from me through their idols.
<DT><A NAME="14:6">14:6</A><DD>Therefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Repent, and turn <I>yourselves</I> from your idols; and turn away your faces from all your abominations.
<DT><A NAME="14:7">14:7</A><DD>For every one of the house of Israel, or of the stranger that sojourneth in Israel, which separateth himself from me, and setteth up his idols in his heart, and putteth the stumblingblock of his iniquity before his face, and cometh to a prophet to enquire of him concerning me; I the LORD will answer him by myself:
<DT><A NAME="14:8">14:8</A><DD>And I will set my face against that man, and will make him a sign and a proverb, and I will cut him off from the midst of my people; and ye shall know that I <I>am</I> the LORD.
<DT><A NAME="14:9">14:9</A><DD>And if the prophet be deceived when he hath spoken a thing, I the LORD have deceived that prophet, and I will stretch out my hand upon him, and will destroy him from the midst of my people Israel.
<DT><A NAME="14:10">14:10</A><DD>And they shall bear the punishment of their iniquity: the punishment of the prophet shall be even as the punishment of him that seeketh <I>unto him</I>;
<DT><A NAME="14:11">14:11</A><DD>That the house of Israel may go no more astray from me, neither be polluted any more with all their transgressions; but that they may be my people, and I may be their God, saith the Lord GOD.
<DT><A NAME="14:12">14:12</A><DD>The word of the LORD came again to me, saying,
<DT><A NAME="14:13">14:13</A><DD>Son of man, when the land sinneth against me by trespassing grievously, then will I stretch out mine hand upon it, and will break the staff of the bread thereof, and will send famine upon it, and will cut off man and beast from it:
<DT><A NAME="14:14">14:14</A><DD>Though these three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, they should deliver <I>but</I> their own souls by their righteousness, saith the Lord GOD.
<DT><A NAME="14:15">14:15</A><DD>If I cause noisome beasts to pass through the land, and they spoil it, so that it be desolate, that no man may pass through because of the beasts:
<DT><A NAME="14:16">14:16</A><DD><I>Though</I> these three men <I>were</I> in it, <I>as</I> I live, saith the Lord GOD, they shall deliver neither sons nor daughters; they only shall be delivered, but the land shall be desolate.
<DT><A NAME="14:17">14:17</A><DD>Or <I>if</I> I bring a sword upon that land, and say, Sword, go through the land; so that I cut off man and beast from it:
<DT><A NAME="14:18">14:18</A><DD>Though these three men <I>were</I> in it, <I>as</I> I live, saith the Lord GOD, they shall deliver neither sons nor daughters, but they only shall be delivered themselves.
<DT><A NAME="14:19">14:19</A><DD>Or <I>if</I> I send a pestilence into that land, and pour out my fury upon it in blood, to cut off from it man and beast:
<DT><A NAME="14:20">14:20</A><DD>Though Noah, Daniel, and Job, <I>were</I> in it, <I>as</I> I live, saith the Lord GOD, they shall deliver neither son nor daughter; they shall <I>but</I> deliver their own souls by their righteousness.
<DT><A NAME="14:21">14:21</A><DD>For thus saith the Lord GOD; How much more when I send my four sore judgments upon Jerusalem, the sword, and the famine, and the noisome beast, and the pestilence, to cut off from it man and beast?
<DT><A NAME="14:22">14:22</A><DD>Yet, behold, therein shall be left a remnant that shall be brought forth, <I>both</I> sons and daughters: behold, they shall come forth unto you, and ye shall see their way and their doings: and ye shall be comforted concerning the evil that I have brought upon Jerusalem, <I>even</I> concerning all that I have brought upon it.
<DT><A NAME="14:23">14:23</A><DD>And they shall comfort you, when ye see their ways and their doings: and ye shall know that I have not done without cause all that I have done in it, saith the Lord GOD.

<DT><A NAME="15:1">15:1</A><DD>And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,
<DT><A NAME="15:2">15:2</A><DD>Son of man, What is the vine tree more than any tree, <I>or than</I> a branch which is among the trees of the forest?
<DT><A NAME="15:3">15:3</A><DD>Shall wood be taken thereof to do any work? or will <I>men</I> take a pin of it to hang any vessel thereon?
<DT><A NAME="15:4">15:4</A><DD>Behold, it is cast into the fire for fuel; the fire devoureth both the ends of it, and the midst of it is burned. Is it meet for <I>any</I> work?
<DT><A NAME="15:5">15:5</A><DD>Behold, when it was whole, it was meet for no work: how much less shall it be meet yet for <I>any</I> work, when the fire hath devoured it, and it is burned?
<DT><A NAME="15:6">15:6</A><DD>Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; As the vine tree among the trees of the forest, which I have given to the fire for fuel, so will I give the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
<DT><A NAME="15:7">15:7</A><DD>And I will set my face against them; they shall go out from <I>one</I> fire, and <I>another</I> fire shall devour them; and ye shall know that I <I>am</I> the LORD, when I set my face against them.
<DT><A NAME="15:8">15:8</A><DD>And I will make the land desolate, because they have committed a trespass, saith the Lord GOD.
</DL></DIV><H2>Chapter 16</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="16:1">16:1</A><DD>Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,
<DT><A NAME="16:2">16:2</A><DD>Son of man, cause Jerusalem to know her abominations,
<DT><A NAME="16:3">16:3</A><DD>And say, Thus saith the Lord GOD unto Jerusalem; Thy birth and thy nativity <I>is</I> of the land of Canaan; thy father <I>was</I> an Amorite, and thy mother an Hittite.
<DT><A NAME="16:4">16:4</A><DD>And <I>as for</I> thy nativity, in the day thou wast born thy navel was not cut, neither wast thou washed in water to supple <I>thee</I>; thou wast not salted at all, nor swaddled at all.
<DT><A NAME="16:5">16:5</A><DD>None eye pitied thee, to do any of these unto thee, to have compassion upon thee; but thou wast cast out in the open field, to the lothing of thy person, in the day that thou wast born.
<DT><A NAME="16:6">16:6</A><DD>And when I passed by thee, and saw thee polluted in thine own blood, I said unto thee <I>when thou wast</I> in thy blood, Live; yea, I said unto thee <I>when thou wast</I> in thy blood, Live.
<DT><A NAME="16:7">16:7</A><DD>I have caused thee to multiply as the bud of the field, and thou hast increased and waxen great, and thou art come to excellent ornaments: <I>thy</I> breasts are fashioned, and thine hair is grown, whereas thou <I>wast</I> naked and bare.
<DT><A NAME="16:8">16:8</A><DD>Now when I passed by thee, and looked upon thee, behold, thy time <I>was</I> the time of love; and I spread my skirt over thee, and covered thy nakedness: yea, I sware unto thee, and entered into a covenant with thee, saith the Lord GOD, and thou becamest mine.
<DT><A NAME="16:9">16:9</A><DD>Then washed I thee with water; yea, I throughly washed away thy blood from thee, and I anointed thee with oil.
<DT><A NAME="16:10">16:10</A><DD>I clothed thee also with broidered work, and shod thee with badgers' skin, and I girded thee about with fine linen, and I covered thee with silk.
<DT><A NAME="16:11">16:11</A><DD>I decked thee also with ornaments, and I put bracelets upon thy hands, and a chain on thy neck.
<DT><A NAME="16:12">16:12</A><DD>And I put a jewel on thy forehead, and earrings in thine ears, and a beautiful crown upon thine head.
<DT><A NAME="16:13">16:13</A><DD>Thus wast thou decked with gold and silver; and thy raiment <I>was of</I> fine linen, and silk, and broidered work; thou didst eat fine flour, and honey, and oil: and thou wast exceeding beautiful, and thou didst prosper into a kingdom.
<DT><A NAME="16:14">16:14</A><DD>And thy renown went forth among the heathen for thy beauty: for it <I>was</I> perfect through my comeliness, which I had put upon thee, saith the Lord GOD.
<DT><A NAME="16:15">16:15</A><DD>But thou didst trust in thine own beauty, and playedst the harlot because of thy renown, and pouredst out thy fornications on every one that passed by; his it was.
<DT><A NAME="16:16">16:16</A><DD>And of thy garments thou didst take, and deckedst thy high places with divers colours, and playedst the harlot thereupon: <I>the like things</I> shall not come, neither shall it be <I>so</I>.
<DT><A NAME="16:17">16:17</A><DD>Thou hast also taken thy fair jewels of my gold and of my silver, which I had given thee, and madest to thyself images of men, and didst commit whoredom with them,
<DT><A NAME="16:18">16:18</A><DD>And tookest thy broidered garments, and coveredst them: and thou hast set mine oil and mine incense before them.
<DT><A NAME="16:19">16:19</A><DD>My meat also which I gave thee, fine flour, and oil, and honey, <I>wherewith</I> I fed thee, thou hast even set it before them for a sweet savour: and <I>thus</I> it was, saith the Lord GOD.
<DT><A NAME="16:20">16:20</A><DD>Moreover thou hast taken thy sons and thy daughters, whom thou hast borne unto me, and these hast thou sacrificed unto them to be devoured. <I>Is this</I> of thy whoredoms a small matter,
<DT><A NAME="16:21">16:21</A><DD>That thou hast slain my children, and delivered them to cause them to pass through <I>the fire</I> for them?
<DT><A NAME="16:22">16:22</A><DD>And in all thine abominations and thy whoredoms thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth, when thou wast naked and bare, <I>and</I> wast polluted in thy blood.
<DT><A NAME="16:23">16:23</A><DD>And it came to pass after all thy wickedness, (woe, woe unto thee! saith the Lord GOD;)
<DT><A NAME="16:24">16:24</A><DD><I>That</I> thou hast also built unto thee an eminent place, and hast made thee an high place in every street.
<DT><A NAME="16:25">16:25</A><DD>Thou hast built thy high place at every head of the way, and hast made thy beauty to be abhorred, and hast opened thy feet to every one that passed by, and multiplied thy whoredoms.
<DT><A NAME="16:26">16:26</A><DD>Thou hast also committed fornication with the Egyptians thy neighbours, great of flesh; and hast increased thy whoredoms, to provoke me to anger.
<DT><A NAME="16:27">16:27</A><DD>Behold, therefore I have stretched out my hand over thee, and have diminished thine ordinary <I>food</I>, and delivered thee unto the will of them that hate thee, the daughters of the Philistines, which are ashamed of thy lewd way.
<DT><A NAME="16:28">16:28</A><DD>Thou hast played the whore also with the Assyrians, because thou wast unsatiable; yea, thou hast played the harlot with them, and yet couldest not be satisfied.
<DT><A NAME="16:29">16:29</A><DD>Thou hast moreover multiplied thy fornication in the land of Canaan unto Chaldea; and yet thou wast not satisfied herewith.
<DT><A NAME="16:30">16:30</A><DD>How weak is thine heart, saith the Lord GOD, seeing thou doest all these <I>things</I>, the work of an imperious whorish woman;
<DT><A NAME="16:31">16:31</A><DD>In that thou buildest thine eminent place in the head of every way, and makest thine high place in every street; and hast not been as an harlot, in that thou scornest hire;
<DT><A NAME="16:32">16:32</A><DD><I>But as</I> a wife that committeth adultery, <I>which</I> taketh strangers instead of her husband!
<DT><A NAME="16:33">16:33</A><DD>They give gifts to all whores: but thou givest thy gifts to all thy lovers, and hirest them, that they may come unto thee on every side for thy whoredom.
<DT><A NAME="16:34">16:34</A><DD>And the contrary is in thee from <I>other</I> women in thy whoredoms, whereas none followeth thee to commit whoredoms: and in that thou givest a reward, and no reward is given unto thee, therefore thou art contrary.
<DT><A NAME="16:35">16:35</A><DD>Wherefore, O harlot, hear the word of the LORD:
<DT><A NAME="16:36">16:36</A><DD>Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thy filthiness was poured out, and thy nakedness discovered through thy whoredoms with thy lovers, and with all the idols of thy abominations, and by the blood of thy children, which thou didst give unto them;
<DT><A NAME="16:37">16:37</A><DD>Behold, therefore I will gather all thy lovers, with whom thou hast taken pleasure, and all <I>them</I> that thou hast loved, with all <I>them</I> that thou hast hated; I will even gather them round about against thee, and will discover thy nakedness unto them, that they may see all thy nakedness.
<DT><A NAME="16:38">16:38</A><DD>And I will judge thee, as women that break wedlock and shed blood are judged; and I will give thee blood in fury and jealousy.
<DT><A NAME="16:39">16:39</A><DD>And I will also give thee into their hand, and they shall throw down thine eminent place, and shall break down thy high places: they shall strip thee also of thy clothes, and shall take thy fair jewels, and leave thee naked and bare.
<DT><A NAME="16:40">16:40</A><DD>They shall also bring up a company against thee, and they shall stone thee with stones, and thrust thee through with their swords.
<DT><A NAME="16:41">16:41</A><DD>And they shall burn thine houses with fire, and execute judgments upon thee in the sight of many women: and I will cause thee to cease from playing the harlot, and thou also shalt give no hire any more.

<DT><A NAME="21:21">21:21</A><DD>For the king of Babylon stood at the parting of the way, at the head of the two ways, to use divination: he made <I>his</I> arrows bright, he consulted with images, he looked in the liver.

<DT><A NAME="23:1">23:1</A><DD>The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying,

<DT><A NAME="23:3">23:3</A><DD>And they committed whoredoms in Egypt; they committed whoredoms in their youth: there were their breasts pressed, and there they bruised the teats of their virginity.
<DT><A NAME="23:4">23:4</A><DD>And the names of them <I>were</I> Aholah the elder, and Aholibah her sister: and they were mine, and they bare sons and daughters. Thus <I>were</I> their names; Samaria <I>is</I> Aholah, and Jerusalem Aholibah.
<DT><A NAME="23:5">23:5</A><DD>And Aholah played the harlot when she was mine; and she doted on her lovers, on the Assyrians <I>her</I> neighbours,
<DT><A NAME="23:6">23:6</A><DD><I>Which were</I> clothed with blue, captains and rulers, all of them desirable young men, horsemen riding upon horses.
<DT><A NAME="23:7">23:7</A><DD>Thus she committed her whoredoms with them, with all them <I>that were</I> the chosen men of Assyria, and with all on whom she doted: with all their idols she defiled herself.
<DT><A NAME="23:8">23:8</A><DD>Neither left she her whoredoms <I>brought</I> from Egypt: for in her youth they lay with her, and they bruised the breasts of her virginity, and poured their whoredom upon her.
<DT><A NAME="23:9">23:9</A><DD>Wherefore I have delivered her into the hand of her lovers, into the hand of the Assyrians, upon whom she doted.
<DT><A NAME="23:10">23:10</A><DD>These discovered her nakedness: they took her sons and her daughters, and slew her with the sword: and she became famous among women; for they had executed judgment upon her.
<DT><A NAME="23:11">23:11</A><DD>And when her sister Aholibah saw <I>this</I>, she was more corrupt in her inordinate love than she, and in her whoredoms more than her sister in <I>her</I> whoredoms.
<DT><A NAME="23:12">23:12</A><DD>She doted upon the Assyrians <I>her</I> neighbours, captains and rulers clothed most gorgeously, horsemen riding upon horses, all of them desirable young men.
<DT><A NAME="23:13">23:13</A><DD>Then I saw that she was defiled, <I>that</I> they <I>took</I> both one way,
<DT><A NAME="23:14">23:14</A><DD>And <I>that</I> she increased her whoredoms: for when she saw men pourtrayed upon the wall, the images of the Chaldeans pourtrayed with vermilion,
<DT><A NAME="23:15">23:15</A><DD>Girded with girdles upon their loins, exceeding in dyed attire upon their heads, all of them princes to look to, after the manner of the Babylonians of Chaldea, the land of their nativity:
<DT><A NAME="23:16">23:16</A><DD>And as soon as she saw them with her eyes, she doted upon them, and sent messengers unto them into Chaldea.
<DT><A NAME="23:17">23:17</A><DD>And the Babylonians came to her into the bed of love, and they defiled her with their whoredom, and she was polluted with them, and her mind was alienated from them.
<DT><A NAME="23:18">23:18</A><DD>So she discovered her whoredoms, and discovered her nakedness: then my mind was alienated from her, like as my mind was alienated from her sister.
<DT><A NAME="23:19">23:19</A><DD>Yet she multiplied her whoredoms, in calling to remembrance the days of her youth, wherein she had played the harlot in the land of Egypt.
<DT><A NAME="23:20">23:20</A><DD>For she doted upon their paramours, whose flesh <I>is as</I> the flesh of asses, and whose issue <I>is like</I> the issue of horses.
<DT><A NAME="23:21">23:21</A><DD>Thus thou calledst to remembrance the lewdness of thy youth, in bruising thy teats by the Egyptians for the paps of thy youth.
<DT><A NAME="23:22">23:22</A><DD>Therefore, O Aholibah, thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will raise up thy lovers against thee, from whom thy mind is alienated, and I will bring them against thee on every side;
<DT><A NAME="23:23">23:23</A><DD>The Babylonians, and all the Chaldeans, Pekod, and Shoa, and Koa, <I>and</I> all the Assyrians with them: all of them desirable young men, captains and rulers, great lords and renowned, all of them riding upon horses.
<DT><A NAME="23:24">23:24</A><DD>And they shall come against thee with chariots, wagons, and wheels, and with an assembly of people, <I>which</I> shall set against thee buckler and shield and helmet round about: and I will set judgment before them, and they shall judge thee according to their judgments.
<DT><A NAME="23:25">23:25</A><DD>And I will set my jealousy against thee, and they shall deal furiously with thee: they shall take away thy nose and thine ears; and thy remnant shall fall by the sword: they shall take thy sons and thy daughters; and thy residue shall be devoured by the fire.
<DT><A NAME="23:26">23:26</A><DD>They shall also strip thee out of thy clothes, and take away thy fair jewels.
<DT><A NAME="23:27">23:27</A><DD>Thus will I make thy lewdness to cease from thee, and thy whoredom <I>brought</I> from the land of Egypt: so that thou shalt not lift up thine eyes unto them, nor remember Egypt any more.
<DT><A NAME="23:28">23:28</A><DD>For thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will deliver thee into the hand <I>of them</I> whom thou hatest, into the hand <I>of them</I> from whom thy mind is alienated:
<DT><A NAME="23:29">23:29</A><DD>And they shall deal with thee hatefully, and shall take away all thy labour, and shall leave thee naked and bare: and the nakedness of thy whoredoms shall be discovered, both thy lewdness and thy whoredoms.
<DT><A NAME="23:30">23:30</A><DD>I will do these <I>things</I> unto thee, because thou hast gone a whoring after the heathen, <I>and</I> because thou art polluted with their idols.
<DT><A NAME="23:31">23:31</A><DD>Thou hast walked in the way of thy sister; therefore will I give her cup into thine hand.
<DT><A NAME="23:32">23:32</A><DD>Thus saith the Lord GOD; Thou shalt drink of thy sister's cup deep and large: thou shalt be laughed to scorn and had in derision; it containeth much.
<DT><A NAME="23:33">23:33</A><DD>Thou shalt be filled with drunkenness and sorrow, with the cup of astonishment and desolation, with the cup of thy sister Samaria.

<DT><A NAME="23:38">23:38</A><DD>Moreover this they have done unto me: they have defiled my sanctuary in the same day, and have profaned my sabbaths.
<DT><A NAME="23:39">23:39</A><DD>For when they had slain their children to their idols, then they came the same day into my sanctuary to profane it; and, lo, thus have they done in the midst of mine house.
<DT><A NAME="23:40">23:40</A><DD>And furthermore, that ye have sent for men to come from far, unto whom a messenger <I>was</I> sent; and, lo, they came: for whom thou didst wash thyself, paintedst thy eyes, and deckedst thyself with ornaments,
<DT><A NAME="23:41">23:41</A><DD>And satest upon a stately bed, and a table prepared before it, whereupon thou hast set mine incense and mine oil.
<DT><A NAME="23:42">23:42</A><DD>And a voice of a multitude being at ease <I>was</I> with her: and with the men of the common sort <I>were</I> brought Sabeans from the wilderness, which put bracelets upon their hands, and beautiful crowns upon their heads.
<DT><A NAME="23:43">23:43</A><DD>Then said I unto <I>her that was</I> old in adulteries, Will they now commit whoredoms with her, and she <I>with them</I>?
<DT><A NAME="23:44">23:44</A><DD>Yet they went in unto her, as they go in unto a woman that playeth the harlot: so went they in unto Aholah and unto Aholibah, the lewd women.
<DT><A NAME="23:45">23:45</A><DD>And the righteous men, they shall judge them after the manner of adulteresses, and after the manner of women that shed blood; because they <I>are</I> adulteresses, and blood <I>is</I> in their hands.
<DT><A NAME="23:46">23:46</A><DD>For thus saith the Lord GOD; I will bring up a company upon them, and will give them to be removed and spoiled.
<DT><A NAME="23:47">23:47</A><DD>And the company shall stone them with stones, and dispatch them with their swords; they shall slay their sons and their daughters, and burn up their houses with fire.
