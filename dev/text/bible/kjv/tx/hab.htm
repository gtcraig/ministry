<DT><A NAME="1:1">1:1</A><DD>The burden which Habakkuk the prophet did see.
<DT><A NAME="1:2">1:2</A><DD>O LORD, how long shall I cry, and thou wilt not hear! <I>even</I> cry out unto thee <I>of</I> violence, and thou wilt not save!
<DT><A NAME="1:3">1:3</A><DD>Why dost thou shew me iniquity, and cause <I>me</I> to behold grievance? for spoiling and violence <I>are</I> before me: and there are <I>that</I> raise up strife and contention.
<DT><A NAME="1:4">1:4</A><DD>Therefore the law is slacked, and judgment doth never go forth: for the wicked doth compass about the righteous; therefore wrong judgment proceedeth.
<DT><A NAME="1:5">1:5</A><DD>Behold ye among the heathen, and regard, and wonder marvellously: for <I>I</I> will work a work in your days, <I>which</I> ye will not believe, though it be told <I>you</I>.
<DT><A NAME="1:6">1:6</A><DD>For, lo, I raise up the Chaldeans, <I>that</I> bitter and hasty nation, which shall march through the breadth of the land, to possess the dwellingplaces <I>that are</I> not theirs.
<DT><A NAME="1:7">1:7</A><DD>They <I>are</I> terrible and dreadful: their judgment and their dignity shall proceed of themselves.
<DT><A NAME="1:8">1:8</A><DD>Their horses also are swifter than the leopards, and are more fierce than the evening wolves: and their horsemen shall spread themselves, and their horsemen shall come from far; they shall fly as the eagle <I>that</I> hasteth to eat.
<DT><A NAME="1:9">1:9</A><DD>They shall come all for violence: their faces shall sup up <I>as</I> the east wind, and they shall gather the captivity as the sand.
<DT><A NAME="1:10">1:10</A><DD>And they shall scoff at the kings, and the princes shall be a scorn unto them: they shall deride every strong hold; for they shall heap dust, and take it.
<DT><A NAME="1:11">1:11</A><DD>Then shall <I>his</I> mind change, and he shall pass over, and offend, <I>imputing</I> this his power unto his god.
<DT><A NAME="1:12">1:12</A><DD><I>Art</I> thou not from everlasting, O LORD my God, mine Holy One? we shall not die. O LORD, thou hast ordained them for judgment; and, O mighty God, thou hast established them for correction.
<DT><A NAME="1:13">1:13</A><DD><I>Thou art</I> of purer eyes than to behold evil, and canst not look on iniquity: wherefore lookest thou upon them that deal treacherously, <I>and</I> holdest thy tongue when the wicked devoureth <I>the man that is</I> more righteous than he?
<DT><A NAME="1:14">1:14</A><DD>And makest men as the fishes of the sea, as the creeping things, <I>that have</I> no ruler over them?
<DT><A NAME="1:15">1:15</A><DD>They take up all of them with the angle, they catch them in their net, and gather them in their drag: therefore they rejoice and are glad.
<DT><A NAME="1:16">1:16</A><DD>Therefore they sacrifice unto their net, and burn incense unto their drag; because by them their portion <I>is</I> fat, and their meat plenteous.
<DT><A NAME="1:17">1:17</A><DD>Shall they therefore empty their net, and not spare continually to slay the nations?
</DL></DIV><H2>Chapter 2</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="2:1">2:1</A><DD>I will stand upon my watch, and set me upon the tower, and will watch to see what he will say unto me, and what I shall answer when I am reproved.
<DT><A NAME="2:2">2:2</A><DD>And the LORD answered me, and said, Write the vision, and make <I>it</I> plain upon tables, that he may run that readeth it.
<DT><A NAME="2:3">2:3</A><DD>For the vision <I>is</I> yet for an appointed time, but at the end it shall speak, and not lie: though it tarry, wait for it; because it will surely come, it will not tarry.
<DT><A NAME="2:4">2:4</A><DD>Behold, his soul <I>which</I> is lifted up is not upright in him: but the just shall live by his faith.
<DT><A NAME="2:5">2:5</A><DD>Yea also, because he transgresseth by wine, <I>he is</I> a proud man, neither keepeth at home, who enlargeth his desire as hell, and <I>is</I> as death, and cannot be satisfied, but gathereth unto him all nations, and heapeth unto him all people:
<DT><A NAME="2:6">2:6</A><DD>Shall not all these take up a parable against him, and a taunting proverb against him, and say, Woe to him that increaseth <I>that which is</I> not his! how long? and to him that ladeth himself with thick clay!
<DT><A NAME="2:7">2:7</A><DD>Shall they not rise up suddenly that shall bite thee, and awake that shall vex thee, and thou shalt be for booties unto them?
<DT><A NAME="2:8">2:8</A><DD>Because thou hast spoiled many nations, all the remnant of the people shall spoil thee; because of men's blood, and <I>for</I> the violence of the land, of the city, and of all that dwell therein.
<DT><A NAME="2:9">2:9</A><DD>Woe to him that coveteth an evil covetousness to his house, that he may set his nest on high, that he may be delivered from the power of evil!
<DT><A NAME="2:10">2:10</A><DD>Thou hast consulted shame to thy house by cutting off many people, and hast sinned <I>against</I> thy soul.
<DT><A NAME="2:11">2:11</A><DD>For the stone shall cry out of the wall, and the beam out of the timber shall answer it.
<DT><A NAME="2:12">2:12</A><DD>Woe to him that buildeth a town with blood, and stablisheth a city by iniquity!
<DT><A NAME="2:13">2:13</A><DD>Behold, <I>is it</I> not of the LORD of hosts that the people shall labour in the very fire, and the people shall weary themselves for very vanity?
<DT><A NAME="2:14">2:14</A><DD>For the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the LORD, as the waters cover the sea.
<DT><A NAME="2:15">2:15</A><DD>Woe unto him that giveth his neighbour drink, that puttest thy bottle to <I>him</I>, and makest <I>him</I> drunken also, that thou mayest look on their nakedness!
<DT><A NAME="2:16">2:16</A><DD>Thou art filled with shame for glory: drink thou also, and let thy foreskin be uncovered: the cup of the LORD'S right hand shall be turned unto thee, and shameful spewing <I>shall be</I> on thy glory.
<DT><A NAME="2:17">2:17</A><DD>For the violence of Lebanon shall cover thee, and the spoil of beasts, <I>which</I> made them afraid, because of men's blood, and for the violence of the land, of the city, and of all that dwell therein.
<DT><A NAME="2:18">2:18</A><DD>What profiteth the graven image that the maker thereof hath graven it; the molten image, and a teacher of lies, that the maker of his work trusteth therein, to make dumb idols?
<DT><A NAME="2:19">2:19</A><DD>Woe unto him that saith to the wood, Awake; to the dumb stone, Arise, it shall teach! Behold, it <I>is</I> laid over with gold and silver, and <I>there is</I> no breath at all in the midst of it.
<DT><A NAME="2:20">2:20</A><DD>But the LORD <I>is</I> in his holy temple: let all the earth keep silence before him.
</DL></DIV><H2>Chapter 3</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="3:1">3:1</A><DD>A prayer of Habakkuk the prophet upon Shigionoth.
<DT><A NAME="3:2">3:2</A><DD>O LORD, I have heard thy speech, <I>and</I> was afraid: O LORD, revive thy work in the midst of the years, in the midst of the years make known; in wrath remember mercy.
<DT><A NAME="3:3">3:3</A><DD>God came from Teman, and the Holy One from mount Paran. Selah. His glory covered the heavens, and the earth was full of his praise.
<DT><A NAME="3:4">3:4</A><DD>And <I>his</I> brightness was as the light; he had horns <I>coming</I> out of his hand: and there <I>was</I> the hiding of his power.
<DT><A NAME="3:5">3:5</A><DD>Before him went the pestilence, and burning coals went forth at his feet.
<DT><A NAME="3:6">3:6</A><DD>He stood, and measured the earth: he beheld, and drove asunder the nations; and the everlasting mountains were scattered, the perpetual hills did bow: his ways <I>are</I> everlasting.
<DT><A NAME="3:7">3:7</A><DD>I saw the tents of Cushan in affliction: <I>and</I> the curtains of the land of Midian did tremble.
<DT><A NAME="3:8">3:8</A><DD>Was the LORD displeased against the rivers? <I>was</I> thine anger against the rivers? <I>was</I> thy wrath against the sea, that thou didst ride upon thine horses <I>and</I> thy chariots of salvation?
<DT><A NAME="3:9">3:9</A><DD>Thy bow was made quite naked, <I>according</I> to the oaths of the tribes, <I>even thy</I> word. Selah. Thou didst cleave the earth with rivers.
<DT><A NAME="3:10">3:10</A><DD>The mountains saw thee, <I>and</I> they trembled: the overflowing of the water passed by: the deep uttered his voice, <I>and</I> lifted up his hands on high.
<DT><A NAME="3:11">3:11</A><DD>The sun <I>and</I> moon stood still in their habitation: at the light of thine arrows they went, <I>and</I> at the shining of thy glittering spear.
<DT><A NAME="3:12">3:12</A><DD>Thou didst march through the land in indignation, thou didst thresh the heathen in anger.
<DT><A NAME="3:13">3:13</A><DD>Thou wentest forth for the salvation of thy people, <I>even</I> for salvation with thine anointed; thou woundedst the head out of the house of the wicked, by discovering the foundation unto the neck. Selah.
<DT><A NAME="3:14">3:14</A><DD>Thou didst strike through with his staves the head of his villages: they came out as a whirlwind to scatter me: their rejoicing <I>was</I> as to devour the poor secretly.
<DT><A NAME="3:15">3:15</A><DD>Thou didst walk through the sea with thine horses, <I>through</I> the heap of great waters.
<DT><A NAME="3:16">3:16</A><DD>When I heard, my belly trembled; my lips quivered at the voice: rottenness entered into my bones, and I trembled in myself, that I might rest in the day of trouble: when he cometh up unto the people, he will invade them with his troops.
<DT><A NAME="3:17">3:17</A><DD>Although the fig tree shall not blossom, neither <I>shall</I> fruit <I>be</I> in the vines; the labour of the olive shall fail, and the fields shall yield no meat; the flock shall be cut off from the fold, and <I>there shall be</I> no herd in the stalls:
<DT><A NAME="3:18">3:18</A><DD>Yet I will rejoice in the LORD, I will joy in the God of my salvation.
<DT><A NAME="3:19">3:19</A><DD>The LORD God <I>is</I> my strength, and he will make my feet like hinds' <I>feet</I>, and he will make me to walk upon mine high places. To the chief singer on my stringed instruments.
