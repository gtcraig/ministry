<DT><A NAME="1:1">1:1</A><DD>The word of the LORD that came to Micah the Morasthite in the days of Jotham, Ahaz, <I>and</I> Hezekiah, kings of Judah, which he saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem.
<DT><A NAME="1:2">1:2</A><DD>Hear, all ye people; hearken, O earth, and all that therein is: and let the Lord GOD be witness against you, the Lord from his holy temple.
<DT><A NAME="1:3">1:3</A><DD>For, behold, the LORD cometh forth out of his place, and will come down, and tread upon the high places of the earth.
<DT><A NAME="1:4">1:4</A><DD>And the mountains shall be molten under him, and the valleys shall be cleft, as wax before the fire, <I>and</I> as the waters <I>that are</I> poured down a steep place.
<DT><A NAME="1:5">1:5</A><DD>For the transgression of Jacob <I>is</I> all this, and for the sins of the house of Israel. What <I>is</I> the transgression of Jacob? <I>is it</I> not Samaria? and what <I>are</I> the high places of Judah? <I>are they</I> not Jerusalem?
<DT><A NAME="1:6">1:6</A><DD>Therefore I will make Samaria as an heap of the field, <I>and</I> as plantings of a vineyard: and I will pour down the stones thereof into the valley, and I will discover the foundations thereof.
<DT><A NAME="1:7">1:7</A><DD>And all the graven images thereof shall be beaten to pieces, and all the hires thereof shall be burned with the fire, and all the idols thereof will I lay desolate: for she gathered <I>it</I> of the hire of an harlot, and they shall return to the hire of an harlot.
<DT><A NAME="1:8">1:8</A><DD>Therefore I will wail and howl, I will go stripped and naked: I will make a wailing like the dragons, and mourning as the owls.
<DT><A NAME="1:9">1:9</A><DD>For her wound <I>is</I> incurable; for it is come unto Judah; he is come unto the gate of my people, <I>even</I> to Jerusalem.
<DT><A NAME="1:10">1:10</A><DD>Declare ye <I>it</I> not at Gath, weep ye not at all: in the house of Aphrah roll thyself in the dust.
<DT><A NAME="1:11">1:11</A><DD>Pass ye away, thou inhabitant of Saphir, having thy shame naked: the inhabitant of Zaanan came not forth in the mourning of Bethezel; he shall receive of you his standing.
<DT><A NAME="1:12">1:12</A><DD>For the inhabitant of Maroth waited carefully for good: but evil came down from the LORD unto the gate of Jerusalem.
<DT><A NAME="1:13">1:13</A><DD>O thou inhabitant of Lachish, bind the chariot to the swift beast: she <I>is</I> the beginning of the sin to the daughter of Zion: for the transgressions of Israel were found in thee.
<DT><A NAME="1:14">1:14</A><DD>Therefore shalt thou give presents to Moreshethgath: the houses of Achzib <I>shall be</I> a lie to the kings of Israel.
<DT><A NAME="1:15">1:15</A><DD>Yet will I bring an heir unto thee, O inhabitant of Mareshah: he shall come unto Adullam the glory of Israel.
<DT><A NAME="1:16">1:16</A><DD>Make thee bald, and poll thee for thy delicate children; enlarge thy baldness as the eagle; for they are gone into captivity from thee.
</DL></DIV><H2>Chapter 2</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="2:1">2:1</A><DD>Woe to them that devise iniquity, and work evil upon their beds! when the morning is light, they practise it, because it is in the power of their hand.
<DT><A NAME="2:2">2:2</A><DD>And they covet fields, and take <I>them</I> by violence; and houses, and take <I>them</I> away: so they oppress a man and his house, even a man and his heritage.
<DT><A NAME="2:3">2:3</A><DD>Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, against this family do I devise an evil, from which ye shall not remove your necks; neither shall ye go haughtily: for this time <I>is</I> evil.
<DT><A NAME="2:4">2:4</A><DD>In that day shall <I>one</I> take up a parable against you, and lament with a doleful lamentation, <I>and</I> say, We be utterly spoiled: he hath changed the portion of my people: how hath he removed <I>it</I> from me! turning away he hath divided our fields.
<DT><A NAME="2:5">2:5</A><DD>Therefore thou shalt have none that shall cast a cord by lot in the congregation of the LORD.
<DT><A NAME="2:6">2:6</A><DD>Prophesy ye not, <I>say they to them that</I> prophesy: they shall not prophesy to them, <I>that</I> they shall not take shame.
<DT><A NAME="2:7">2:7</A><DD>O <I>thou that art</I> named the house of Jacob, is the spirit of the LORD straitened? <I>are</I> these his doings? do not my words do good to him that walketh uprightly?
<DT><A NAME="2:8">2:8</A><DD>Even of late my people is risen up as an enemy: ye pull off the robe with the garment from them that pass by securely as men averse from war.
<DT><A NAME="2:9">2:9</A><DD>The women of my people have ye cast out from their pleasant houses; from their children have ye taken away my glory for ever.
<DT><A NAME="2:10">2:10</A><DD>Arise ye, and depart; for this <I>is</I> not <I>your</I> rest: because it is polluted, it shall destroy <I>you</I>, even with a sore destruction.
<DT><A NAME="2:11">2:11</A><DD>If a man walking in the spirit and falsehood do lie, <I>saying</I>, I will prophesy unto thee of wine and of strong drink; he shall even be the prophet of this people.
<DT><A NAME="2:12">2:12</A><DD>I will surely assemble, O Jacob, all of thee; I will surely gather the remnant of Israel; I will put them together as the sheep of Bozrah, as the flock in the midst of their fold: they shall make great noise by reason of <I>the multitude of</I> men.
<DT><A NAME="2:13">2:13</A><DD>The breaker is come up before them: they have broken up, and have passed through the gate, and are gone out by it: and their king shall pass before them, and the LORD on the head of them.
</DL></DIV><H2>Chapter 3</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="3:1">3:1</A><DD>And I said, Hear, I pray you, O heads of Jacob, and ye princes of the house of Israel; <I>Is it</I> not for you to know judgment?
<DT><A NAME="3:2">3:2</A><DD>Who hate the good, and love the evil; who pluck off their skin from off them, and their flesh from off their bones;
<DT><A NAME="3:3">3:3</A><DD>Who also eat the flesh of my people, and flay their skin from off them; and they break their bones, and chop them in pieces, as for the pot, and as flesh within the caldron.
<DT><A NAME="3:4">3:4</A><DD>Then shall they cry unto the LORD, but he will not hear them: he will even hide his face from them at that time, as they have behaved themselves ill in their doings.
<DT><A NAME="3:5">3:5</A><DD>Thus saith the LORD concerning the prophets that make my people err, that bite with their teeth, and cry, Peace; and he that putteth not into their mouths, they even prepare war against him.
<DT><A NAME="3:6">3:6</A><DD>Therefore night <I>shall be</I> unto you, that ye shall not have a vision; and it shall be dark unto you, that ye shall not divine; and the sun shall go down over the prophets, and the day shall be dark over them.
<DT><A NAME="3:7">3:7</A><DD>Then shall the seers be ashamed, and the diviners confounded: yea, they shall all cover their lips; for <I>there is</I> no answer of God.
<DT><A NAME="3:8">3:8</A><DD>But truly I am full of power by the spirit of the LORD, and of judgment, and of might, to declare unto Jacob his transgression, and to Israel his sin.
<DT><A NAME="3:9">3:9</A><DD>Hear this, I pray you, ye heads of the house of Jacob, and princes of the house of Israel, that abhor judgment, and pervert all equity.
<DT><A NAME="3:10">3:10</A><DD>They build up Zion with blood, and Jerusalem with iniquity.
<DT><A NAME="3:11">3:11</A><DD>The heads thereof judge for reward, and the priests thereof teach for hire, and the prophets thereof divine for money: yet will they lean upon the LORD, and say, <I>Is</I> not the LORD among us? none evil can come upon us.
<DT><A NAME="3:12">3:12</A><DD>Therefore shall Zion for your sake be plowed <I>as</I> a field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of the house as the high places of the forest.
</DL></DIV><H2>Chapter 4</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="4:1">4:1</A><DD>But in the last days it shall come to pass, <I>that</I> the mountain of the house of the LORD shall be established in the top of the mountains, and it shall be exalted above the hills; and people shall flow unto it.
<DT><A NAME="4:2">4:2</A><DD>And many nations shall come, and say, Come, and let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, and to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for the law shall go forth of Zion, and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.
<DT><A NAME="4:3">4:3</A><DD>And he shall judge among many people, and rebuke strong nations afar off; and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruninghooks: nation shall not lift up a sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.
<DT><A NAME="4:4">4:4</A><DD>But they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig tree; and none shall make <I>them</I> afraid: for the mouth of the LORD of hosts hath spoken <I>it</I>.
<DT><A NAME="4:5">4:5</A><DD>For all people will walk every one in the name of his god, and we will walk in the name of the LORD our God for ever and ever.
<DT><A NAME="4:6">4:6</A><DD>In that day, saith the LORD, will I assemble her that halteth, and I will gather her that is driven out, and her that I have afflicted;
<DT><A NAME="4:7">4:7</A><DD>And I will make her that halted a remnant, and her that was cast far off a strong nation: and the LORD shall reign over them in mount Zion from henceforth, even for ever.
<DT><A NAME="4:8">4:8</A><DD>And thou, O tower of the flock, the strong hold of the daughter of Zion, unto thee shall it come, even the first dominion; the kingdom shall come to the daughter of Jerusalem.
<DT><A NAME="4:9">4:9</A><DD>Now why dost thou cry out aloud? <I>is there</I> no king in thee? is thy counsellor perished? for pangs have taken thee as a woman in travail.
<DT><A NAME="4:10">4:10</A><DD>Be in pain, and labour to bring forth, O daughter of Zion, like a woman in travail: for now shalt thou go forth out of the city, and thou shalt dwell in the field, and thou shalt go <I>even</I> to Babylon; there shalt thou be delivered; there the LORD shall redeem thee from the hand of thine enemies.
<DT><A NAME="4:11">4:11</A><DD>Now also many nations are gathered against thee, that say, Let her be defiled, and let our eye look upon Zion.
<DT><A NAME="4:12">4:12</A><DD>But they know not the thoughts of the LORD, neither understand they his counsel: for he shall gather them as the sheaves into the floor.
<DT><A NAME="4:13">4:13</A><DD>Arise and thresh, O daughter of Zion: for I will make thine horn iron, and I will make thy hoofs brass: and thou shalt beat in pieces many people: and I will consecrate their gain unto the LORD, and their substance unto the Lord of the whole earth.
</DL></DIV><H2>Chapter 5</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="5:1">5:1</A><DD>Now gather thyself in troops, O daughter of troops: he hath laid siege against us: they shall smite the judge of Israel with a rod upon the cheek.
<DT><A NAME="5:2">5:2</A><DD>But thou, Bethlehem Ephratah, <I>though</I> thou be little among the thousands of Judah, <I>yet</I> out of thee shall he come forth unto me <I>that is</I> to be ruler in Israel; whose goings forth <I>have been</I> from of old, from everlasting.
<DT><A NAME="5:3">5:3</A><DD>Therefore will he give them up, until the time <I>that</I> she which travaileth hath brought forth: then the remnant of his brethren shall return unto the children of Israel.
<DT><A NAME="5:4">5:4</A><DD>And he shall stand and feed in the strength of the LORD, in the majesty of the name of the LORD his God; and they shall abide: for now shall he be great unto the ends of the earth.
<DT><A NAME="5:5">5:5</A><DD>And this <I>man</I> shall be the peace, when the Assyrian shall come into our land: and when he shall tread in our palaces, then shall we raise against him seven shepherds, and eight principal men.
<DT><A NAME="5:6">5:6</A><DD>And they shall waste the land of Assyria with the sword, and the land of Nimrod in the entrances thereof: thus shall he deliver <I>us</I> from the Assyrian, when he cometh into our land, and when he treadeth within our borders.
<DT><A NAME="5:7">5:7</A><DD>And the remnant of Jacob shall be in the midst of many people as a dew from the LORD, as the showers upon the grass, that tarrieth not for man, nor waiteth for the sons of men.
<DT><A NAME="5:8">5:8</A><DD>And the remnant of Jacob shall be among the Gentiles in the midst of many people as a lion among the beasts of the forest, as a young lion among the flocks of sheep: who, if he go through, both treadeth down, and teareth in pieces, and none can deliver.
<DT><A NAME="5:9">5:9</A><DD>Thine hand shall be lifted up upon thine adversaries, and all thine enemies shall be cut off.
<DT><A NAME="5:10">5:10</A><DD>And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the LORD, that I will cut off thy horses out of the midst of thee, and I will destroy thy chariots:
<DT><A NAME="5:11">5:11</A><DD>And I will cut off the cities of thy land, and throw down all thy strong holds:
<DT><A NAME="5:12">5:12</A><DD>And I will cut off witchcrafts out of thine hand; and thou shalt have no <I>more</I> soothsayers:
<DT><A NAME="5:13">5:13</A><DD>Thy graven images also will I cut off, and thy standing images out of the midst of thee; and thou shalt no more worship the work of thine hands.
<DT><A NAME="5:14">5:14</A><DD>And I will pluck up thy groves out of the midst of thee: so will I destroy thy cities.
<DT><A NAME="5:15">5:15</A><DD>And I will execute vengeance in anger and fury upon the heathen, such as they have not heard.

<DT><A NAME="6:1">6:1</A><DD>Hear ye now what the LORD saith; Arise, contend thou before the mountains, and let the hills hear thy voice.
<DT><A NAME="6:2">6:2</A><DD>Hear ye, O mountains, the LORD'S controversy, and ye strong foundations of the earth: for the LORD hath a controversy with his people, and he will plead with Israel.
<DT><A NAME="6:3">6:3</A><DD>O my people, what have I done unto thee? and wherein have I wearied thee? testify against me.
<DT><A NAME="6:4">6:4</A><DD>For I brought thee up out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed thee out of the house of servants; and I sent before thee Moses, Aaron, and Miriam.
<DT><A NAME="6:5">6:5</A><DD>O my people, remember now what Balak king of Moab consulted, and what Balaam the son of Beor answered him from Shittim unto Gilgal; that ye may know the righteousness of the LORD.
<DT><A NAME="6:6">6:6</A><DD>Wherewith shall I come before the LORD, <I>and</I> bow myself before the high God? shall I come before him with burnt offerings, with calves of a year old?
<DT><A NAME="6:7">6:7</A><DD>Will the LORD be pleased with thousands of rams, <I>or</I> with ten thousands of rivers of oil? shall I give my firstborn <I>for</I> my transgression, the fruit of my body <I>for</I> the sin of my soul?
<DT><A NAME="6:8">6:8</A><DD>He hath shewed thee, O man, what <I>is</I> good; and what doth the LORD require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?
<DT><A NAME="6:9">6:9</A><DD>The LORD'S voice crieth unto the city, and <I>the man of</I> wisdom shall see thy name: hear ye the rod, and who hath appointed it.
<DT><A NAME="6:10">6:10</A><DD>Are there yet the treasures of wickedness in the house of the wicked, and the scant measure <I>that is</I> abominable?
<DT><A NAME="6:11">6:11</A><DD>Shall I count <I>them</I> pure with the wicked balances, and with the bag of deceitful weights?
<DT><A NAME="6:12">6:12</A><DD>For the rich men thereof are full of violence, and the inhabitants thereof have spoken lies, and their tongue <I>is</I> deceitful in their mouth.
<DT><A NAME="6:13">6:13</A><DD>Therefore also will I make <I>thee</I> sick in smiting thee, in making <I>thee</I> desolate because of thy sins.
<DT><A NAME="6:14">6:14</A><DD>Thou shalt eat, but not be satisfied; and thy casting down <I>shall be</I> in the midst of thee; and thou shalt take hold, but shalt not deliver; and <I>that</I> which thou deliverest will I give up to the sword.
<DT><A NAME="6:15">6:15</A><DD>Thou shalt sow, but thou shalt not reap; thou shalt tread the olives, but thou shalt not anoint thee with oil; and sweet wine, but shalt not drink wine.
<DT><A NAME="6:16">6:16</A><DD>For the statutes of Omri are kept, and all the works of the house of Ahab, and ye walk in their counsels; that I should make thee a desolation, and the inhabitants thereof an hissing: therefore ye shall bear the reproach of my people.

<DT><A NAME="7:1">7:1</A><DD>Woe is me! for I am as when they have gathered the summer fruits, as the grapegleanings of the vintage: <I>there is</I> no cluster to eat: my soul desired the firstripe fruit.
<DT><A NAME="7:2">7:2</A><DD>The good <I>man</I> is perished out of the earth: and <I>there is</I> none upright among men: they all lie in wait for blood; they hunt every man his brother with a net.
<DT><A NAME="7:3">7:3</A><DD>That they may do evil with both hands earnestly, the prince asketh, and the judge <I>asketh</I> for a reward; and the great <I>man</I>, he uttereth his mischievous desire: so they wrap it up.
<DT><A NAME="7:4">7:4</A><DD>The best of them <I>is</I> as a brier: the most upright <I>is sharper</I> than a thorn hedge: the day of thy watchmen <I>and</I> thy visitation cometh; now shall be their perplexity.
<DT><A NAME="7:5">7:5</A><DD>Trust ye not in a friend, put ye not confidence in a guide: keep the doors of thy mouth from her that lieth in thy bosom.
<DT><A NAME="7:6">7:6</A><DD>For the son dishonoureth the father, the daughter riseth up against her mother, the daughter in law against her mother in law; a man's enemies <I>are</I> the men of his own house.
<DT><A NAME="7:7">7:7</A><DD>Therefore I will look unto the LORD; I will wait for the God of my salvation: my God will hear me.
<DT><A NAME="7:8">7:8</A><DD>Rejoice not against me, O mine enemy: when I fall, I shall arise; when I sit in darkness, the LORD <I>shall be</I> a light unto me.
<DT><A NAME="7:9">7:9</A><DD>I will bear the indignation of the LORD, because I have sinned against him, until he plead my cause, and execute judgment for me: he will bring me forth to the light, <I>and</I> I shall behold his righteousness.
<DT><A NAME="7:10">7:10</A><DD>Then <I>she that is</I> mine enemy shall see <I>it</I>, and shame shall cover her which said unto me, Where is the LORD thy God? mine eyes shall behold her: now shall she be trodden down as the mire of the streets.
<DT><A NAME="7:11">7:11</A><DD><I>In</I> the day that thy walls are to be built, <I>in</I> that day shall the decree be far removed.
<DT><A NAME="7:12">7:12</A><DD><I>In</I> that day <I>also</I> he shall come even to thee from Assyria, and <I>from</I> the fortified cities, and from the fortress even to the river, and from sea to sea, and <I>from</I> mountain to mountain.
<DT><A NAME="7:13">7:13</A><DD>Notwithstanding the land shall be desolate because of them that dwell therein, for the fruit of their doings.
<DT><A NAME="7:14">7:14</A><DD>Feed thy people with thy rod, the flock of thine heritage, which dwell solitarily <I>in</I> the wood, in the midst of Carmel: let them feed <I>in</I> Bashan and Gilead, as in the days of old.
<DT><A NAME="7:15">7:15</A><DD>According to the days of thy coming out of the land of Egypt will I shew unto him marvellous <I>things</I>.
<DT><A NAME="7:16">7:16</A><DD>The nations shall see and be confounded at all their might: they shall lay <I>their</I> hand upon <I>their</I> mouth, their ears shall be deaf.
<DT><A NAME="7:17">7:17</A><DD>They shall lick the dust like a serpent, they shall move out of their holes like worms of the earth: they shall be afraid of the LORD our God, and shall fear because of thee.
<DT><A NAME="7:18">7:18</A><DD>Who <I>is</I> a God like unto thee, that pardoneth iniquity, and passeth by the transgression of the remnant of his heritage? he retaineth not his anger for ever, because he delighteth <I>in</I> mercy.
<DT><A NAME="7:19">7:19</A><DD>He will turn again, he will have compassion upon us; he will subdue our iniquities; and thou wilt cast all their sins into the depths of the sea.
<DT><A NAME="7:20">7:20</A><DD>Thou wilt perform the truth to Jacob, <I>and</I> the mercy to Abraham, which thou hast sworn unto our fathers from the days of old.
