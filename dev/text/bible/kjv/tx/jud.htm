<H2>Chapter 1</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="1:1">1:1</A><DD>Now after the death of Joshua it came to pass, that the children of Israel asked the LORD, saying, Who shall go up for us against the Canaanites first, to fight against them?
<DT><A NAME="1:2">1:2</A><DD>And the LORD said, Judah shall go up: behold, I have delivered the land into his hand.
<DT><A NAME="1:3">1:3</A><DD>And Judah said unto Simeon his brother, Come up with me into my lot, that we may fight against the Canaanites; and I likewise will go with thee into thy lot. So Simeon went with him.
<DT><A NAME="1:4">1:4</A><DD>And Judah went up; and the LORD delivered the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hand: and they slew of them in Bezek ten thousand men.
<DT><A NAME="1:5">1:5</A><DD>And they found Adonibezek in Bezek: and they fought against him, and they slew the Canaanites and the Perizzites.
<DT><A NAME="1:6">1:6</A><DD>But Adonibezek fled; and they pursued after him, and caught him, and cut off his thumbs and his great toes.
<DT><A NAME="1:7">1:7</A><DD>And Adonibezek said, Threescore and ten kings, having their thumbs and their great toes cut off, gathered <I>their meat</I> under my table: as I have done, so God hath requited me. And they brought him to Jerusalem, and there he died.
<DT><A NAME="1:8">1:8</A><DD>Now the children of Judah had fought against Jerusalem, and had taken it, and smitten it with the edge of the sword, and set the city on fire.
<DT><A NAME="1:9">1:9</A><DD>And afterward the children of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites, that dwelt in the mountain, and in the south, and in the valley.
<DT><A NAME="1:10">1:10</A><DD>And Judah went against the Canaanites that dwelt in Hebron: (now the name of Hebron before <I>was</I> Kirjatharba:) and they slew Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai.
<DT><A NAME="1:11">1:11</A><DD>And from thence he went against the inhabitants of Debir: and the name of Debir before <I>was</I> Kirjathsepher:
<DT><A NAME="1:12">1:12</A><DD>And Caleb said, He that smiteth Kirjathsepher, and taketh it, to him will I give Achsah my daughter to wife.
<DT><A NAME="1:13">1:13</A><DD>And Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother, took it: and he gave him Achsah his daughter to wife.
<DT><A NAME="1:14">1:14</A><DD>And it came to pass, when she came <I>to him</I>, that she moved him to ask of her father a field: and she lighted from off <I>her</I> ass; and Caleb said unto her, What wilt thou?
<DT><A NAME="1:15">1:15</A><DD>And she said unto him, Give me a blessing: for thou hast given me a south land; give me also springs of water. And Caleb gave her the upper springs and the nether springs.
<DT><A NAME="1:16">1:16</A><DD>And the children of the Kenite, Moses' father in law, went up out of the city of palm trees with the children of Judah into the wilderness of Judah, which <I>lieth</I> in the south of Arad; and they went and dwelt among the people.
<DT><A NAME="1:17">1:17</A><DD>And Judah went with Simeon his brother, and they slew the Canaanites that inhabited Zephath, and utterly destroyed it. And the name of the city was called Hormah.
<DT><A NAME="1:18">1:18</A><DD>Also Judah took Gaza with the coast thereof, and Askelon with the coast thereof, and Ekron with the coast thereof.
<DT><A NAME="1:19">1:19</A><DD>And the LORD was with Judah; and he drave out <I>the inhabitants of</I> the mountain; but could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley, because they had chariots of iron.
<DT><A NAME="1:20">1:20</A><DD>And they gave Hebron unto Caleb, as Moses said: and he expelled thence the three sons of Anak.
<DT><A NAME="1:21">1:21</A><DD>And the children of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites that inhabited Jerusalem; but the Jebusites dwell with the children of Benjamin in Jerusalem unto this day.
<DT><A NAME="1:22">1:22</A><DD>And the house of Joseph, they also went up against Bethel: and the LORD <I>was</I> with them.
<DT><A NAME="1:23">1:23</A><DD>And the house of Joseph sent to descry Bethel. (Now the name of the city before <I>was</I> Luz.)
<DT><A NAME="1:24">1:24</A><DD>And the spies saw a man come forth out of the city, and they said unto him, Shew us, we pray thee, the entrance into the city, and we will shew thee mercy.
<DT><A NAME="1:25">1:25</A><DD>And when he shewed them the entrance into the city, they smote the city with the edge of the sword; but they let go the man and all his family.
<DT><A NAME="1:26">1:26</A><DD>And the man went into the land of the Hittites, and built a city, and called the name thereof Luz: which <I>is</I> the name thereof unto this day.
<DT><A NAME="1:27">1:27</A><DD>Neither did Manasseh drive out <I>the inhabitants of</I> Bethshean and her towns, nor Taanach and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Dor and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Ibleam and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Megiddo and her towns: but the Canaanites would dwell in that land.
<DT><A NAME="1:28">1:28</A><DD>And it came to pass, when Israel was strong, that they put the Canaanites to tribute, and did not utterly drive them out.
<DT><A NAME="1:29">1:29</A><DD>Neither did Ephraim drive out the Canaanites that dwelt in Gezer; but the Canaanites dwelt in Gezer among them.
<DT><A NAME="1:30">1:30</A><DD>Neither did Zebulun drive out the inhabitants of Kitron, nor the inhabitants of Nahalol; but the Canaanites dwelt among them, and became tributaries.
<DT><A NAME="1:31">1:31</A><DD>Neither did Asher drive out the inhabitants of Accho, nor the inhabitants of Zidon, nor of Ahlab, nor of Achzib, nor of Helbah, nor of Aphik, nor of Rehob:
<DT><A NAME="1:32">1:32</A><DD>But the Asherites dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land: for they did not drive them out.
<DT><A NAME="1:33">1:33</A><DD>Neither did Naphtali drive out the inhabitants of Bethshemesh, nor the inhabitants of Bethanath; but he dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land: nevertheless the inhabitants of Bethshemesh and of Bethanath became tributaries unto them.
<DT><A NAME="1:34">1:34</A><DD>And the Amorites forced the children of Dan into the mountain: for they would not suffer them to come down to the valley:
<DT><A NAME="1:35">1:35</A><DD>But the Amorites would dwell in mount Heres in Aijalon, and in Shaalbim: yet the hand of the house of Joseph prevailed, so that they became tributaries.
<DT><A NAME="1:36">1:36</A><DD>And the coast of the Amorites <I>was</I> from the going up to Akrabbim, from the rock, and upward.
</DL></DIV><H2>Chapter 2</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="2:1">2:1</A><DD>And an angel of the LORD came up from Gilgal to Bochim, and said, I made you to go up out of Egypt, and have brought you unto the land which I sware unto your fathers; and I said, I will never break my covenant with you.
<DT><A NAME="2:2">2:2</A><DD>And ye shall make no league with the inhabitants of this land; ye shall throw down their altars: but ye have not obeyed my voice: why have ye done this?
<DT><A NAME="2:3">2:3</A><DD>Wherefore I also said, I will not drive them out from before you; but they shall be <I>as thorns</I> in your sides, and their gods shall be a snare unto you.
<DT><A NAME="2:4">2:4</A><DD>And it came to pass, when the angel of the LORD spake these words unto all the children of Israel, that the people lifted up their voice, and wept.
<DT><A NAME="2:5">2:5</A><DD>And they called the name of that place Bochim: and they sacrificed there unto the LORD.
<DT><A NAME="2:6">2:6</A><DD>And when Joshua had let the people go, the children of Israel went every man unto his inheritance to possess the land.
<DT><A NAME="2:7">2:7</A><DD>And the people served the LORD all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders that outlived Joshua, who had seen all the great works of the LORD, that he did for Israel.
<DT><A NAME="2:8">2:8</A><DD>And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died, <I>being</I> an hundred and ten years old.
<DT><A NAME="2:9">2:9</A><DD>And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnathheres, in the mount of Ephraim, on the north side of the hill Gaash.
<DT><A NAME="2:10">2:10</A><DD>And also all that generation were gathered unto their fathers: and there arose another generation after them, which knew not the LORD, nor yet the works which he had done for Israel.
<DT><A NAME="2:11">2:11</A><DD>And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD, and served Baalim:
<DT><A NAME="2:12">2:12</A><DD>And they forsook the LORD God of their fathers, which brought them out of the land of Egypt, and followed other gods, of the gods of the people that <I>were</I> round about them, and bowed themselves unto them, and provoked the LORD to anger.
<DT><A NAME="2:13">2:13</A><DD>And they forsook the LORD, and served Baal and Ashtaroth.
<DT><A NAME="2:14">2:14</A><DD>And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he delivered them into the hands of spoilers that spoiled them, and he sold them into the hands of their enemies round about, so that they could not any longer stand before their enemies.
<DT><A NAME="2:15">2:15</A><DD>Whithersoever they went out, the hand of the LORD was against them for evil, as the LORD had said, and as the LORD had sworn unto them: and they were greatly distressed.
<DT><A NAME="2:16">2:16</A><DD>Nevertheless the LORD raised up judges, which delivered them out of the hand of those that spoiled them.
<DT><A NAME="2:17">2:17</A><DD>And yet they would not hearken unto their judges, but they went a whoring after other gods, and bowed themselves unto them: they turned quickly out of the way which their fathers walked in, obeying the commandments of the LORD; <I>but</I> they did not so.
<DT><A NAME="2:18">2:18</A><DD>And when the LORD raised them up judges, then the LORD was with the judge, and delivered them out of the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge: for it repented the LORD because of their groanings by reason of them that oppressed them and vexed them.
<DT><A NAME="2:19">2:19</A><DD>And it came to pass, when the judge was dead, <I>that</I> they returned, and corrupted <I>themselves</I> more than their fathers, in following other gods to serve them, and to bow down unto them; they ceased not from their own doings, nor from their stubborn way.
<DT><A NAME="2:20">2:20</A><DD>And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel; and he said, Because that this people hath transgressed my covenant which I commanded their fathers, and have not hearkened unto my voice;
<DT><A NAME="2:21">2:21</A><DD>I also will not henceforth drive out any from before them of the nations which Joshua left when he died:
<DT><A NAME="2:22">2:22</A><DD>That through them I may prove Israel, whether they will keep the way of the LORD to walk therein, as their fathers did keep <I>it</I>, or not.
<DT><A NAME="2:23">2:23</A><DD>Therefore the LORD left those nations, without driving them out hastily; neither delivered he them into the hand of Joshua.
</DL></DIV><H2>Chapter 3</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="3:1">3:1</A><DD>Now these <I>are</I> the nations which the LORD left, to prove Israel by them, <I>even</I> as many <I>of Israel</I> as had not known all the wars of Canaan;
<DT><A NAME="3:2">3:2</A><DD>Only that the generations of the children of Israel might know, to teach them war, at the least such as before knew nothing thereof;
<DT><A NAME="3:3">3:3</A><DD><I>Namely</I>, five lords of the Philistines, and all the Canaanites, and the Sidonians, and the Hivites that dwelt in mount Lebanon, from mount Baalhermon unto the entering in of Hamath.
<DT><A NAME="3:4">3:4</A><DD>And they were to prove Israel by them, to know whether they would hearken unto the commandments of the LORD, which he commanded their fathers by the hand of Moses.
<DT><A NAME="3:5">3:5</A><DD>And the children of Israel dwelt among the Canaanites, Hittites, and Amorites, and Perizzites, and Hivites, and Jebusites:
<DT><A NAME="3:6">3:6</A><DD>And they took their daughters to be their wives, and gave their daughters to their sons, and served their gods.
<DT><A NAME="3:7">3:7</A><DD>And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD, and forgat the LORD their God, and served Baalim and the groves.
<DT><A NAME="3:8">3:8</A><DD>Therefore the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of Chushanrishathaim king of Mesopotamia: and the children of Israel served Chushanrishathaim eight years.
<DT><A NAME="3:9">3:9</A><DD>And when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, the LORD raised up a deliverer to the children of Israel, who delivered them, <I>even</I> Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother.
<DT><A NAME="3:10">3:10</A><DD>And the Spirit of the LORD came upon him, and he judged Israel, and went out to war: and the LORD delivered Chushanrishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand; and his hand prevailed against Chushanrishathaim.
<DT><A NAME="3:11">3:11</A><DD>And the land had rest forty years. And Othniel the son of Kenaz died.
<DT><A NAME="3:12">3:12</A><DD>And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD: and the LORD strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel, because they had done evil in the sight of the LORD.
<DT><A NAME="3:13">3:13</A><DD>And he gathered unto him the children of Ammon and Amalek, and went and smote Israel, and possessed the city of palm trees.
<DT><A NAME="3:14">3:14</A><DD>So the children of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years.
<DT><A NAME="3:15">3:15</A><DD>But when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, the LORD raised them up a deliverer, Ehud the son of Gera, a Benjamite, a man lefthanded: and by him the children of Israel sent a present unto Eglon the king of Moab.
<DT><A NAME="3:16">3:16</A><DD>But Ehud made him a dagger which had two edges, of a cubit length; and he did gird it under his raiment upon his right thigh.
<DT><A NAME="3:17">3:17</A><DD>And he brought the present unto Eglon king of Moab: and Eglon <I>was</I> a very fat man.
<DT><A NAME="3:18">3:18</A><DD>And when he had made an end to offer the present, he sent away the people that bare the present.
<DT><A NAME="3:19">3:19</A><DD>But he himself turned again from the quarries that <I>were</I> by Gilgal, and said, I have a secret errand unto thee, O king: who said, Keep silence. And all that stood by him went out from him.
<DT><A NAME="3:20">3:20</A><DD>And Ehud came unto him; and he was sitting in a summer parlour, which he had for himself alone. And Ehud said, I have a message from God unto thee. And he arose out of <I>his</I> seat.
<DT><A NAME="3:21">3:21</A><DD>And Ehud put forth his left hand, and took the dagger from his right thigh, and thrust it into his belly:
<DT><A NAME="3:22">3:22</A><DD>And the haft also went in after the blade; and the fat closed upon the blade, so that he could not draw the dagger out of his belly; and the dirt came out.
<DT><A NAME="3:23">3:23</A><DD>Then Ehud went forth through the porch, and shut the doors of the parlour upon him, and locked them.
<DT><A NAME="3:24">3:24</A><DD>When he was gone out, his servants came; and when they saw that, behold, the doors of the parlour <I>were</I> locked, they said, Surely he covereth his feet in his summer chamber.
<DT><A NAME="3:25">3:25</A><DD>And they tarried till they were ashamed: and, behold, he opened not the doors of the parlour; therefore they took a key, and opened <I>them</I>: and, behold, their lord <I>was</I> fallen down dead on the earth.
<DT><A NAME="3:26">3:26</A><DD>And Ehud escaped while they tarried, and passed beyond the quarries, and escaped unto Seirath.
<DT><A NAME="3:27">3:27</A><DD>And it came to pass, when he was come, that he blew a trumpet in the mountain of Ephraim, and the children of Israel went down with him from the mount, and he before them.
<DT><A NAME="3:28">3:28</A><DD>And he said unto them, Follow after me: for the LORD hath delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand. And they went down after him, and took the fords of Jordan toward Moab, and suffered not a man to pass over.
<DT><A NAME="3:29">3:29</A><DD>And they slew of Moab at that time about ten thousand men, all lusty, and all men of valour; and there escaped not a man.
<DT><A NAME="3:30">3:30</A><DD>So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. And the land had rest fourscore years.
<DT><A NAME="3:31">3:31</A><DD>And after him was Shamgar the son of Anath, which slew of the Philistines six hundred men with an ox goad: and he also delivered Israel.
</DL></DIV><H2>Chapter 4</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="4:1">4:1</A><DD>And the children of Israel again did evil in the sight of the LORD, when Ehud was dead.
<DT><A NAME="4:2">4:2</A><DD>And the LORD sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan, that reigned in Hazor; the captain of whose host <I>was</I> Sisera, which dwelt in Harosheth of the Gentiles.
<DT><A NAME="4:3">4:3</A><DD>And the children of Israel cried unto the LORD: for he had nine hundred chariots of iron; and twenty years he mightily oppressed the children of Israel.
<DT><A NAME="4:4">4:4</A><DD>And Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lapidoth, she judged Israel at that time.
<DT><A NAME="4:5">4:5</A><DD>And she dwelt under the palm tree of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in mount Ephraim: and the children of Israel came up to her for judgment.
<DT><A NAME="4:6">4:6</A><DD>And she sent and called Barak the son of Abinoam out of Kedeshnaphtali, and said unto him, Hath not the LORD God of Israel commanded, <I>saying</I>, Go and draw toward mount Tabor, and take with thee ten thousand men of the children of Naphtali and of the children of Zebulun?
<DT><A NAME="4:7">4:7</A><DD>And I will draw unto thee to the river Kishon Sisera, the captain of Jabin's army, with his chariots and his multitude; and I will deliver him into thine hand.
<DT><A NAME="4:8">4:8</A><DD>And Barak said unto her, If thou wilt go with me, then I will go: but if thou wilt not go with me, <I>then</I> I will not go.
<DT><A NAME="4:9">4:9</A><DD>And she said, I will surely go with thee: notwithstanding the journey that thou takest shall not be for thine honour; for the LORD shall sell Sisera into the hand of a woman. And Deborah arose, and went with Barak to Kedesh.
<DT><A NAME="4:10">4:10</A><DD>And Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh; and he went up with ten thousand men at his feet: and Deborah went up with him.
<DT><A NAME="4:11">4:11</A><DD>Now Heber the Kenite, <I>which was</I> of the children of Hobab the father in law of Moses, had severed himself from the Kenites, and pitched his tent unto the plain of Zaanaim, which <I>is</I> by Kedesh.
<DT><A NAME="4:12">4:12</A><DD>And they shewed Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam was gone up to mount Tabor.
<DT><A NAME="4:13">4:13</A><DD>And Sisera gathered together all his chariots, <I>even</I> nine hundred chariots of iron, and all the people that <I>were</I> with him, from Harosheth of the Gentiles unto the river of Kishon.
<DT><A NAME="4:14">4:14</A><DD>And Deborah said unto Barak, Up; for this <I>is</I> the day in which the LORD hath delivered Sisera into thine hand: is not the LORD gone out before thee? So Barak went down from mount Tabor, and ten thousand men after him.
<DT><A NAME="4:15">4:15</A><DD>And the LORD discomfited Sisera, and all <I>his</I> chariots, and all <I>his</I> host, with the edge of the sword before Barak; so that Sisera lighted down off <I>his</I> chariot, and fled away on his feet.
<DT><A NAME="4:16">4:16</A><DD>But Barak pursued after the chariots, and after the host, unto Harosheth of the Gentiles: and all the host of Sisera fell upon the edge of the sword; <I>and</I> there was not a man left.
<DT><A NAME="4:17">4:17</A><DD>Howbeit Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite: for <I>there was</I> peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite.
<DT><A NAME="4:18">4:18</A><DD>And Jael went out to meet Sisera, and said unto him, Turn in, my lord, turn in to me; fear not. And when he had turned in unto her into the tent, she covered him with a mantle.

<DT><A NAME="6:3">6:3</A><DD>And <I>so</I> it was, when Israel had sown, that the Midianites came up, and the Amalekites, and the children of the east, even they came up against them;

<DT><A NAME="6:7">6:7</A><DD>And it came to pass, when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD because of the Midianites,

<DT><A NAME="6:11">6:11</A><DD>And there came an angel of the LORD, and sat under an oak which <I>was</I> in Ophrah, that <I>pertained</I> unto Joash the Abiezrite: and his son Gideon threshed wheat by the winepress, to hide <I>it</I> from the Midianites.
<DT><A NAME="6:12">6:12</A><DD>And the angel of the LORD appeared unto him, and said unto him, The LORD <I>is</I> with thee, thou mighty man of valour.
<DT><A NAME="6:13">6:13</A><DD>And Gideon said unto him, Oh my Lord, if the LORD be with us, why then is all this befallen us? and where <I>be</I> all his miracles which our fathers told us of, saying, Did not the LORD bring us up from Egypt? but now the LORD hath forsaken us, and delivered us into the hands of the Midianites.
<DT><A NAME="6:14">6:14</A><DD>And the LORD looked upon him, and said, Go in this thy might, and thou shalt save Israel from the hand of the Midianites: have not I sent thee?

<DT><A NAME="6:19">6:19</A><DD>And Gideon went in, and made ready a kid, and unleavened cakes of an ephah of flour: the flesh he put in a basket, and he put the broth in a pot, and brought <I>it</I> out unto him under the oak, and presented <I>it</I>.
<DT><A NAME="6:20">6:20</A><DD>And the angel of God said unto him, Take the flesh and the unleavened cakes, and lay <I>them</I> upon this rock, and pour out the broth. And he did so.
<DT><A NAME="6:21">6:21</A><DD>Then the angel of the LORD put forth the end of the staff that <I>was</I> in his hand, and touched the flesh and the unleavened cakes; and there rose up fire out of the rock, and consumed the flesh and the unleavened cakes. Then the angel of the LORD departed out of his sight.
<DT><A NAME="6:22">6:22</A><DD>And when Gideon perceived that he <I>was</I> an angel of the LORD, Gideon said, Alas, O Lord GOD! for because I have seen an angel of the LORD face to face.

<DT><A NAME="6:24">6:24</A><DD>Then Gideon built an altar there unto the LORD, and called it Jehovahshalom: unto this day it <I>is</I> yet in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.
<DT><A NAME="6:25">6:25</A><DD>And it came to pass the same night, that the LORD said unto him, Take thy father's young bullock, even the second bullock of seven years old, and throw down the altar of Baal that thy father hath, and cut down the grove that <I>is</I> by it:
<DT><A NAME="6:26">6:26</A><DD>And build an altar unto the LORD thy God upon the top of this rock, in the ordered place, and take the second bullock, and offer a burnt sacrifice with the wood of the grove which thou shalt cut down.
<DT><A NAME="6:27">6:27</A><DD>Then Gideon took ten men of his servants, and did as the LORD had said unto him: and <I>so</I> it was, because he feared his father's household, and the men of the city, that he could not do <I>it</I> by day, that he did <I>it</I> by night.
<DT><A NAME="6:28">6:28</A><DD>And when the men of the city arose early in the morning, behold, the altar of Baal was cast down, and the grove was cut down that <I>was</I> by it, and the second bullock was offered upon the altar <I>that was</I> built.
<DT><A NAME="6:29">6:29</A><DD>And they said one to another, Who hath done this thing? And when they enquired and asked, they said, Gideon the son of Joash hath done this thing.
<DT><A NAME="6:30">6:30</A><DD>Then the men of the city said unto Joash, Bring out thy son, that he may die: because he hath cast down the altar of Baal, and because he hath cut down the grove that <I>was</I> by it.
<DT><A NAME="6:31">6:31</A><DD>And Joash said unto all that stood against him, Will ye plead for Baal? will ye save him? he that will plead for him, let him be put to death whilst <I>it is yet</I> morning: if he <I>be</I> a god, let him plead for himself, because <I>one</I> hath cast down his altar.
<DT><A NAME="6:32">6:32</A><DD>Therefore on that day he called him Jerubbaal, saying, Let Baal plead against him, because he hath thrown down his altar.
<DT><A NAME="6:33">6:33</A><DD>Then all the Midianites and the Amalekites and the children of the east were gathered together, and went over, and pitched in the valley of Jezreel.
<DT><A NAME="6:34">6:34</A><DD>But the Spirit of the LORD came upon Gideon, and he blew a trumpet; and Abiezer was gathered after him.
<DT><A NAME="6:35">6:35</A><DD>And he sent messengers throughout all Manasseh; who also was gathered after him: and he sent messengers unto Asher, and unto Zebulun, and unto Naphtali; and they came up to meet them.
<DT><A NAME="6:36">6:36</A><DD>And Gideon said unto God, If thou wilt save Israel by mine hand, as thou hast said,
<DT><A NAME="6:37">6:37</A><DD>Behold, I will put a fleece of wool in the floor; <I>and</I> if the dew be on the fleece only, and <I>it be</I> dry upon all the earth <I>beside</I>, then shall I know that thou wilt save Israel by mine hand, as thou hast said.
<DT><A NAME="6:38">6:38</A><DD>And it was so: for he rose up early on the morrow, and thrust the fleece together, and wringed the dew out of the fleece, a bowl full of water.
<DT><A NAME="6:39">6:39</A><DD>And Gideon said unto God, Let not thine anger be hot against me, and I will speak but this once: let me prove, I pray thee, but this once with the fleece; let it now be dry only upon the fleece, and upon all the ground let there be dew.
<DT><A NAME="6:40">6:40</A><DD>And God did so that night: for it was dry upon the fleece only, and there was dew on all the ground.

<DT><A NAME="7:1">7:1</A><DD>Then Jerubbaal, who <I>is</I> Gideon, and all the people that <I>were</I> with him, rose up early, and pitched beside the well of Harod: so that the host of the Midianites were on the north side of them, by the hill of Moreh, in the valley.
<DT><A NAME="7:2">7:2</A><DD>And the LORD said unto Gideon, The people that <I>are</I> with thee <I>are</I> too many for me to give the Midianites into their hands, lest Israel vaunt themselves against me, saying, Mine own hand hath saved me.
<DT><A NAME="7:3">7:3</A><DD>Now therefore go to, proclaim in the ears of the people, saying, Whosoever <I>is</I> fearful and afraid, let him return and depart early from mount Gilead. And there returned of the people twenty and two thousand; and there remained ten thousand.
<DT><A NAME="7:4">7:4</A><DD>And the LORD said unto Gideon, The people <I>are</I> yet <I>too</I> many; bring them down unto the water, and I will try them for thee there: and it shall be, <I>that</I> of whom I say unto thee, This shall go with thee, the same shall go with thee; and of whomsoever I say unto thee, This shall not go with thee, the same shall not go.
<DT><A NAME="7:5">7:5</A><DD>So he brought down the people unto the water: and the LORD said unto Gideon, Every one that lappeth of the water with his tongue, as a dog lappeth, him shalt thou set by himself; likewise every one that boweth down upon his knees to drink.
<DT><A NAME="7:6">7:6</A><DD>And the number of them that lapped, <I>putting</I> their hand to their mouth, were three hundred men: but all the rest of the people bowed down upon their knees to drink water.
<DT><A NAME="7:7">7:7</A><DD>And the LORD said unto Gideon, By the three hundred men that lapped will I save you, and deliver the Midianites into thine hand: and let all the <I>other</I> people go every man unto his place.
<DT><A NAME="7:8">7:8</A><DD>So the people took victuals in their hand, and their trumpets: and he sent all <I>the rest of</I> Israel every man unto his tent, and retained those three hundred men: and the host of Midian was beneath him in the valley.
<DT><A NAME="7:9">7:9</A><DD>And it came to pass the same night, that the LORD said unto him, Arise, get thee down unto the host; for I have delivered it into thine hand.
<DT><A NAME="7:10">7:10</A><DD>But if thou fear to go down, go thou with Phurah thy servant down to the host:
<DT><A NAME="7:11">7:11</A><DD>And thou shalt hear what they say; and afterward shall thine hands be strengthened to go down unto the host. Then went he down with Phurah his servant unto the outside of the armed men that <I>were</I> in the host.
<DT><A NAME="7:12">7:12</A><DD>And the Midianites and the Amalekites and all the children of the east lay along in the valley like grasshoppers for multitude; and their camels <I>were</I> without number, as the sand by the sea side for multitude.
<DT><A NAME="7:13">7:13</A><DD>And when Gideon was come, behold, <I>there was</I> a man that told a dream unto his fellow, and said, Behold, I dreamed a dream, and, lo, a cake of barley bread tumbled into the host of Midian, and came unto a tent, and smote it that it fell, and overturned it, that the tent lay along.
<DT><A NAME="7:14">7:14</A><DD>And his fellow answered and said, This <I>is</I> nothing else save the sword of Gideon the son of Joash, a man of Israel: <I>for</I> into his hand hath God delivered Midian, and all the host.
<DT><A NAME="7:15">7:15</A><DD>And it was <I>so</I>, when Gideon heard the telling of the dream, and the interpretation thereof, that he worshipped, and returned into the host of Israel, and said, Arise; for the LORD hath delivered into your hand the host of Midian.
<DT><A NAME="7:16">7:16</A><DD>And he divided the three hundred men <I>into</I> three companies, and he put a trumpet in every man's hand, with empty pitchers, and lamps within the pitchers.
<DT><A NAME="7:17">7:17</A><DD>And he said unto them, Look on me, and do likewise: and, behold, when I come to the outside of the camp, it shall be <I>that</I>, as I do, so shall ye do.
<DT><A NAME="7:18">7:18</A><DD>When I blow with a trumpet, I and all that <I>are</I> with me, then blow ye the trumpets also on every side of all the camp, and say, <I>The sword</I> of the LORD, and of Gideon.
<DT><A NAME="7:19">7:19</A><DD>So Gideon, and the hundred men that <I>were</I> with him, came unto the outside of the camp in the beginning of the middle watch; and they had but newly set the watch: and they blew the trumpets, and brake the pitchers that <I>were</I> in their hands.

<DT><A NAME="7:21">7:21</A><DD>And they stood every man in his place round about the camp: and all the host ran, and cried, and fled.
<DT><A NAME="7:22">7:22</A><DD>And the three hundred blew the trumpets, and the LORD set every man's sword against his fellow, even throughout all the host: and the host fled to Bethshittah in Zererath, <I>and</I> to the border of Abelmeholah, unto Tabbath.
<DT><A NAME="7:23">7:23</A><DD>And the men of Israel gathered themselves together out of Naphtali, and out of Asher, and out of all Manasseh, and pursued after the Midianites.
<DT><A NAME="7:24">7:24</A><DD>And Gideon sent messengers throughout all mount Ephraim, saying, Come down against the Midianites, and take before them the waters unto Bethbarah and Jordan. Then all the men of Ephraim gathered themselves together, and took the waters unto Bethbarah and Jordan.
<DT><A NAME="7:25">7:25</A><DD>And they took two princes of the Midianites, Oreb and Zeeb; and they slew Oreb upon the rock Oreb, and Zeeb they slew at the winepress of Zeeb, and pursued Midian, and brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon on the other side Jordan.

<DT><A NAME="8:2">8:2</A><DD>And he said unto them, What have I done now in comparison of you? <I>Is</I> not the gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim better than the vintage of Abiezer?
<DT><A NAME="8:3">8:3</A><DD>God hath delivered into your hands the princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb: and what was I able to do in comparison of you? Then their anger was abated toward him, when he had said that.

<DT><A NAME="9:3">9:3</A><DD>And his mother's brethren spake of him in the ears of all the men of Shechem all these words: and their hearts inclined to follow Abimelech; for they said, He <I>is</I> our brother.
<DT><A NAME="9:4">9:4</A><DD>And they gave him threescore and ten <I>pieces</I> of silver out of the house of Baalberith, wherewith Abimelech hired vain and light persons, which followed him.

<DT><A NAME="9:6">9:6</A><DD>And all the men of Shechem gathered together, and all the house of Millo, and went, and made Abimelech king, by the plain of the pillar that <I>was</I> in Shechem.

<DT><A NAME="9:33">9:33</A><DD>And it shall be, <I>that</I> in the morning, as soon as the sun is up, thou shalt rise early, and set upon the city: and, behold, <I>when</I> he and the people that <I>is</I> with him come out against thee, then mayest thou do to them as thou shalt find occasion.
<DT><A NAME="9:34">9:34</A><DD>And Abimelech rose up, and all the people that <I>were</I> with him, by night, and they laid wait against Shechem in four companies.
<DT><A NAME="9:35">9:35</A><DD>And Gaal the son of Ebed went out, and stood in the entering of the gate of the city: and Abimelech rose up, and the people that <I>were</I> with him, from lying in wait.
<DT><A NAME="9:36">9:36</A><DD>And when Gaal saw the people, he said to Zebul, Behold, there come people down from the top of the mountains. And Zebul said unto him, Thou seest the shadow of the mountains as <I>if they were</I> men.
<DT><A NAME="9:37">9:37</A><DD>And Gaal spake again and said, See there come people down by the middle of the land, and another company come along by the plain of Meonenim.
<DT><A NAME="9:38">9:38</A><DD>Then said Zebul unto him, Where <I>is</I> now thy mouth, wherewith thou saidst, Who <I>is</I> Abimelech, that we should serve him? <I>is</I> not this the people that thou hast despised? go out, I pray now, and fight with them.
<DT><A NAME="9:39">9:39</A><DD>And Gaal went out before the men of Shechem, and fought with Abimelech.
<DT><A NAME="9:40">9:40</A><DD>And Abimelech chased him, and he fled before him, and many were overthrown <I>and</I> wounded, <I>even</I> unto the entering of the gate.
<DT><A NAME="9:41">9:41</A><DD>And Abimelech dwelt at Arumah: and Zebul thrust out Gaal and his brethren, that they should not dwell in Shechem.
<DT><A NAME="9:42">9:42</A><DD>And it came to pass on the morrow, that the people went out into the field; and they told Abimelech.
<DT><A NAME="9:43">9:43</A><DD>And he took the people, and divided them into three companies, and laid wait in the field, and looked, and, behold, the people <I>were</I> come forth out of the city; and he rose up against them, and smote them.
<DT><A NAME="9:44">9:44</A><DD>And Abimelech, and the company that <I>was</I> with him, rushed forward, and stood in the entering of the gate of the city: and the two <I>other</I> companies ran upon all <I>the people</I> that <I>were</I> in the fields, and slew them.
<DT><A NAME="9:45">9:45</A><DD>And Abimelech fought against the city all that day; and he took the city, and slew the people that <I>was</I> therein, and beat down the city, and sowed it with salt.
<DT><A NAME="9:46">9:46</A><DD>And when all the men of the tower of Shechem heard <I>that</I>, they entered into an hold of the house of the god Berith.
<DT><A NAME="9:47">9:47</A><DD>And it was told Abimelech, that all the men of the tower of Shechem were gathered together.
<DT><A NAME="9:48">9:48</A><DD>And Abimelech gat him up to mount Zalmon, he and all the people that <I>were</I> with him; and Abimelech took an axe in his hand, and cut down a bough from the trees, and took it, and laid <I>it</I> on his shoulder, and said unto the people that <I>were</I> with him, What ye have seen me do, make haste, <I>and</I> do as I <I>have done</I>.
<DT><A NAME="9:49">9:49</A><DD>And all the people likewise cut down every man his bough, and followed Abimelech, and put <I>them</I> to the hold, and set the hold on fire upon them; so that all the men of the tower of Shechem died also, about a thousand men and women.
<DT><A NAME="9:50">9:50</A><DD>Then went Abimelech to Thebez, and encamped against Thebez, and took it.
<DT><A NAME="9:51">9:51</A><DD>But there was a strong tower within the city, and thither fled all the men and women, and all they of the city, and shut <I>it</I> to them, and gat them up to the top of the tower.
<DT><A NAME="9:52">9:52</A><DD>And Abimelech came unto the tower, and fought against it, and went hard unto the door of the tower to burn it with fire.
<DT><A NAME="9:53">9:53</A><DD>And a certain woman cast a piece of a millstone upon Abimelech's head, and all to brake his skull.
<DT><A NAME="9:54">9:54</A><DD>Then he called hastily unto the young man his armourbearer, and said unto him, Draw thy sword, and slay me, that men say not of me, A woman slew him. And his young man thrust him through, and he died.
<DT><A NAME="9:55">9:55</A><DD>And when the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead, they departed every man unto his place.
<DT><A NAME="9:56">9:56</A><DD>Thus God rendered the wickedness of Abimelech, which he did unto his father, in slaying his seventy brethren:
<DT><A NAME="9:57">9:57</A><DD>And all the evil of the men of Shechem did God render upon their heads: and upon them came the curse of Jotham the son of Jerubbaal.

<DT><A NAME="13:12">13:12</A><DD>And Manoah said, Now let thy words come to pass. How shall we order the child, and <I>how</I> shall we do unto him?
<DT><A NAME="13:13">13:13</A><DD>And the angel of the LORD said unto Manoah, Of all that I said unto the woman let her beware.

<DT><A NAME="13:19">13:19</A><DD>So Manoah took a kid with a meat offering, and offered <I>it</I> upon a rock unto the LORD: and <I>the angel</I> did wondrously; and Manoah and his wife looked on.
<DT><A NAME="13:20">13:20</A><DD>For it came to pass, when the flame went up toward heaven from off the altar, that the angel of the LORD ascended in the flame of the altar. And Manoah and his wife looked on <I>it</I>, and fell on their faces to the ground.
<DT><A NAME="13:21">13:21</A><DD>But the angel of the LORD did no more appear to Manoah and to his wife. Then Manoah knew that he <I>was</I> an angel of the LORD.

<DT><A NAME="14:4">14:4</A><DD>But his father and his mother knew not that it <I>was</I> of the LORD, that he sought an occasion against the Philistines: for at that time the Philistines had dominion over Israel.

<DT><A NAME="14:8">14:8</A><DD>And after a time he returned to take her, and he turned aside to see the carcase of the lion: and, behold, <I>there was</I> a swarm of bees and honey in the carcase of the lion.
<DT><A NAME="14:9">14:9</A><DD>And he took thereof in his hands, and went on eating, and came to his father and mother, and he gave them, and they did eat: but he told not them that he had taken the honey out of the carcase of the lion.

<DT><A NAME="14:14">14:14</A><DD>And he said unto them, Out of the eater came forth meat, and out of the strong came forth sweetness. And they could not in three days expound the riddle.
<DT><A NAME="14:15">14:15</A><DD>And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they said unto Samson's wife, Entice thy husband, that he may declare unto us the riddle, lest we burn thee and thy father's house with fire: have ye called us to take that we have? <I>is it</I> not <I>so</I>?
<DT><A NAME="14:16">14:16</A><DD>And Samson's wife wept before him, and said, Thou dost but hate me, and lovest me not: thou hast put forth a riddle unto the children of my people, and hast not told <I>it</I> me.

<DT><A NAME="14:17">14:17</A><DD>And she wept before him the seven days, while their feast lasted: and it came to pass on the seventh day, that he told her, because she lay sore upon him: and she told the riddle to the children of her people.

<DT><A NAME="14:19">14:19</A><DD>And the Spirit of the LORD came upon him, and he went down to Ashkelon, and slew thirty men of them, and took their spoil, and gave change of garments unto them which expounded the riddle. And his anger was kindled, and he went up to his father's house.

<DT><A NAME="20:48">20:48</A><DD>And the men of Israel turned again upon the children of Benjamin, and smote them with the edge of the sword, as well the men of <I>every</I> city, as the beast, and all that came to hand: also they set on fire all the cities that they came to.

<DT><A NAME="21:1">21:1</A><DD>Now the men of Israel had sworn in Mizpeh, saying, There shall not any of us give his daughter unto Benjamin to wife.
<DT><A NAME="21:2">21:2</A><DD>And the people came to the house of God, and abode there till even before God, and lifted up their voices, and wept sore;
<DT><A NAME="21:3">21:3</A><DD>And said, O LORD God of Israel, why is this come to pass in Israel, that there should be to day one tribe lacking in Israel?
<DT><A NAME="21:4">21:4</A><DD>And it came to pass on the morrow, that the people rose early, and built there an altar, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings.
<DT><A NAME="21:5">21:5</A><DD>And the children of Israel said, Who <I>is there</I> among all the tribes of Israel that came not up with the congregation unto the LORD? For they had made a great oath concerning him that came not up to the LORD to Mizpeh, saying, He shall surely be put to death.
<DT><A NAME="21:6">21:6</A><DD>And the children of Israel repented them for Benjamin their brother, and said, There is one tribe cut off from Israel this day.
<DT><A NAME="21:7">21:7</A><DD>How shall we do for wives for them that remain, seeing we have sworn by the LORD that we will not give them of our daughters to wives?
<DT><A NAME="21:8">21:8</A><DD>And they said, What one <I>is there</I> of the tribes of Israel that came not up to Mizpeh to the LORD? And, behold, there came none to the camp from Jabeshgilead to the assembly.
<DT><A NAME="21:9">21:9</A><DD>For the people were numbered, and, behold, <I>there were</I> none of the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead there.
<DT><A NAME="21:10">21:10</A><DD>And the congregation sent thither twelve thousand men of the valiantest, and commanded them, saying, Go and smite the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead with the edge of the sword, with the women and the children.
<DT><A NAME="21:11">21:11</A><DD>And this <I>is</I> the thing that ye shall do, Ye shall utterly destroy every male, and every woman that hath lain by man.
<DT><A NAME="21:12">21:12</A><DD>And they found among the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead four hundred young virgins, that had known no man by lying with any male: and they brought them unto the camp to Shiloh, which <I>is</I> in the land of Canaan.
<DT><A NAME="21:13">21:13</A><DD>And the whole congregation sent <I>some</I> to speak to the children of Benjamin that <I>were</I> in the rock Rimmon, and to call peaceably unto them.
<DT><A NAME="21:14">21:14</A><DD>And Benjamin came again at that time; and they gave them wives which they had saved alive of the women of Jabeshgilead: and yet so they sufficed them not.
<DT><A NAME="21:15">21:15</A><DD>And the people repented them for Benjamin, because that the LORD had made a breach in the tribes of Israel.
<DT><A NAME="21:16">21:16</A><DD>Then the elders of the congregation said, How shall we do for wives for them that remain, seeing the women are destroyed out of Benjamin?
<DT><A NAME="21:17">21:17</A><DD>And they said, <I>There must be</I> an inheritance for them that be escaped of Benjamin, that a tribe be not destroyed out of Israel.
<DT><A NAME="21:18">21:18</A><DD>Howbeit we may not give them wives of our daughters: for the children of Israel have sworn, saying, Cursed <I>be</I> he that giveth a wife to Benjamin.
<DT><A NAME="21:19">21:19</A><DD>Then they said, Behold, <I>there is</I> a feast of the LORD in Shiloh yearly <I>in a place</I> which <I>is</I> on the north side of Bethel, on the east side of the highway that goeth up from Bethel to Shechem, and on the south of Lebonah.
<DT><A NAME="21:20">21:20</A><DD>Therefore they commanded the children of Benjamin, saying, Go and lie in wait in the vineyards;
<DT><A NAME="21:21">21:21</A><DD>And see, and, behold, if the daughters of Shiloh come out to dance in dances, then come ye out of the vineyards, and catch you every man his wife of the daughters of Shiloh, and go to the land of Benjamin.
<DT><A NAME="21:22">21:22</A><DD>And it shall be, when their fathers or their brethren come unto us to complain, that we will say unto them, Be favourable unto them for our sakes: because we reserved not to each man his wife in the war: for ye did not give unto them at this time, <I>that</I> ye should be guilty.
<DT><A NAME="21:23">21:23</A><DD>And the children of Benjamin did so, and took <I>them</I> wives, according to their number, of them that danced, whom they caught: and they went and returned unto their inheritance, and repaired the cities, and dwelt in them.
<DT><A NAME="21:24">21:24</A><DD>And the children of Israel departed thence at that time, every man to his tribe and to his family, and they went out from thence every man to his inheritance.
<DT><A NAME="21:25">21:25</A><DD>In those days <I>there was</I> no king in Israel: every man did <I>that which was</I> right in his own eyes.
