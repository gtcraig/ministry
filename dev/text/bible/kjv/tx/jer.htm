<H2>Chapter 1</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="1:1">1:1</A><DD>The words of Jeremiah the son of Hilkiah, of the priests that <I>were</I> in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin:
<DT><A NAME="1:2">1:2</A><DD>To whom the word of the LORD came in the days of Josiah the son of Amon king of Judah, in the thirteenth year of his reign.
<DT><A NAME="1:3">1:3</A><DD>It came also in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, unto the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah the son of Josiah king of Judah, unto the carrying away of Jerusalem captive in the fifth month.
<DT><A NAME="1:4">1:4</A><DD>Then the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,
<DT><A NAME="1:5">1:5</A><DD>Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee; and before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee, <I>and</I> I ordained thee a prophet unto the nations.
<DT><A NAME="1:6">1:6</A><DD>Then said I, Ah, Lord GOD! behold, I cannot speak: for I <I>am</I> a child.
<DT><A NAME="1:7">1:7</A><DD>But the LORD said unto me, Say not, I <I>am</I> a child: for thou shalt go to all that I shall send thee, and whatsoever I command thee thou shalt speak.
<DT><A NAME="1:8">1:8</A><DD>Be not afraid of their faces: for I <I>am</I> with thee to deliver thee, saith the LORD.
<DT><A NAME="1:9">1:9</A><DD>Then the LORD put forth his hand, and touched my mouth. And the LORD said unto me, Behold, I have put my words in thy mouth.
<DT><A NAME="1:10">1:10</A><DD>See, I have this day set thee over the nations and over the kingdoms, to root out, and to pull down, and to destroy, and to throw down, to build, and to plant.
<DT><A NAME="1:11">1:11</A><DD>Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, Jeremiah, what seest thou? And I said, I see a rod of an almond tree.
<DT><A NAME="1:12">1:12</A><DD>Then said the LORD unto me, Thou hast well seen: for I will hasten my word to perform it.
<DT><A NAME="1:13">1:13</A><DD>And the word of the LORD came unto me the second time, saying, What seest thou? And I said, I see a seething pot; and the face thereof <I>is</I> toward the north.
<DT><A NAME="1:14">1:14</A><DD>Then the LORD said unto me, Out of the north an evil shall break forth upon all the inhabitants of the land.
<DT><A NAME="1:15">1:15</A><DD>For, lo, I will call all the families of the kingdoms of the north, saith the LORD; and they shall come, and they shall set every one his throne at the entering of the gates of Jerusalem, and against all the walls thereof round about, and against all the cities of Judah.
<DT><A NAME="1:16">1:16</A><DD>And I will utter my judgments against them touching all their wickedness, who have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto other gods, and worshipped the works of their own hands.
<DT><A NAME="1:17">1:17</A><DD>Thou therefore gird up thy loins, and arise, and speak unto them all that I command thee: be not dismayed at their faces, lest I confound thee before them.
<DT><A NAME="1:18">1:18</A><DD>For, behold, I have made thee this day a defenced city, and an iron pillar, and brasen walls against the whole land, against the kings of Judah, against the princes thereof, against the priests thereof, and against the people of the land.
<DT><A NAME="1:19">1:19</A><DD>And they shall fight against thee; but they shall not prevail against thee; for I <I>am</I> with thee, saith the LORD, to deliver thee.
</DL></DIV><H2>Chapter 2</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="2:1">2:1</A><DD>Moreover the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
<DT><A NAME="2:2">2:2</A><DD>Go and cry in the ears of Jerusalem, saying, Thus saith the LORD; I remember thee, the kindness of thy youth, the love of thine espousals, when thou wentest after me in the wilderness, in a land <I>that was</I> not sown.
<DT><A NAME="2:3">2:3</A><DD>Israel <I>was</I> holiness unto the LORD, <I>and</I> the firstfruits of his increase: all that devour him shall offend; evil shall come upon them, saith the LORD.
<DT><A NAME="2:4">2:4</A><DD>Hear ye the word of the LORD, O house of Jacob, and all the families of the house of Israel:
<DT><A NAME="2:5">2:5</A><DD>Thus saith the LORD, What iniquity have your fathers found in me, that they are gone far from me, and have walked after vanity, and are become vain?
<DT><A NAME="2:6">2:6</A><DD>Neither said they, Where <I>is</I> the LORD that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, that led us through the wilderness, through a land of deserts and of pits, through a land of drought, and of the shadow of death, through a land that no man passed through, and where no man dwelt?
<DT><A NAME="2:7">2:7</A><DD>And I brought you into a plentiful country, to eat the fruit thereof and the goodness thereof; but when ye entered, ye defiled my land, and made mine heritage an abomination.
<DT><A NAME="2:8">2:8</A><DD>The priests said not, Where <I>is</I> the LORD? and they that handle the law knew me not: the pastors also transgressed against me, and the prophets prophesied by Baal, and walked after <I>things that</I> do not profit.
<DT><A NAME="2:9">2:9</A><DD>Wherefore I will yet plead with you, saith the LORD, and with your children's children will I plead.
<DT><A NAME="2:10">2:10</A><DD>For pass over the isles of Chittim, and see; and send unto Kedar, and consider diligently, and see if there be such a thing.
<DT><A NAME="2:11">2:11</A><DD>Hath a nation changed <I>their</I> gods, which <I>are</I> yet no gods? but my people have changed their glory for <I>that which</I> doth not profit.
<DT><A NAME="2:12">2:12</A><DD>Be astonished, O ye heavens, at this, and be horribly afraid, be ye very desolate, saith the LORD.
<DT><A NAME="2:13">2:13</A><DD>For my people have committed two evils; they have forsaken me the fountain of living waters, <I>and</I> hewed them out cisterns, broken cisterns, that can hold no water.
<DT><A NAME="2:14">2:14</A><DD><I>Is</I> Israel a servant? <I>is</I> he a homeborn <I>slave</I>? why is he spoiled?
<DT><A NAME="2:15">2:15</A><DD>The young lions roared upon him, <I>and</I> yelled, and they made his land waste: his cities are burned without inhabitant.
<DT><A NAME="2:16">2:16</A><DD>Also the children of Noph and Tahapanes have broken the crown of thy head.
<DT><A NAME="2:17">2:17</A><DD>Hast thou not procured this unto thyself, in that thou hast forsaken the LORD thy God, when he led thee by the way?
<DT><A NAME="2:18">2:18</A><DD>And now what hast thou to do in the way of Egypt, to drink the waters of Sihor? or what hast thou to do in the way of Assyria, to drink the waters of the river?
<DT><A NAME="2:19">2:19</A><DD>Thine own wickedness shall correct thee, and thy backslidings shall reprove thee: know therefore and see that <I>it is</I> an evil <I>thing</I> and bitter, that thou hast forsaken the LORD thy God, and that my fear <I>is</I> not in thee, saith the Lord GOD of hosts.
<DT><A NAME="2:20">2:20</A><DD>For of old time I have broken thy yoke, <I>and</I> burst thy bands; and thou saidst, I will not transgress; when upon every high hill and under every green tree thou wanderest, playing the harlot.
<DT><A NAME="2:21">2:21</A><DD>Yet I had planted thee a noble vine, wholly a right seed: how then art thou turned into the degenerate plant of a strange vine unto me?
<DT><A NAME="2:22">2:22</A><DD>For though thou wash thee with nitre, and take thee much soap, <I>yet</I> thine iniquity is marked before me, saith the Lord GOD.
<DT><A NAME="2:23">2:23</A><DD>How canst thou say, I am not polluted, I have not gone after Baalim? see thy way in the valley, know what thou hast done: <I>thou art</I> a swift dromedary traversing her ways;
<DT><A NAME="2:24">2:24</A><DD>A wild ass used to the wilderness, <I>that</I> snuffeth up the wind at her pleasure; in her occasion who can turn her away? all they that seek her will not weary themselves; in her month they shall find her.
<DT><A NAME="2:25">2:25</A><DD>Withhold thy foot from being unshod, and thy throat from thirst: but thou saidst, There is no hope: no; for I have loved strangers, and after them will I go.
<DT><A NAME="2:26">2:26</A><DD>As the thief is ashamed when he is found, so is the house of Israel ashamed; they, their kings, their princes, and their priests, and their prophets,
<DT><A NAME="2:27">2:27</A><DD>Saying to a stock, Thou <I>art</I> my father; and to a stone, Thou hast brought me forth: for they have turned <I>their</I> back unto me, and not <I>their</I> face: but in the time of their trouble they will say, Arise, and save us.
<DT><A NAME="2:28">2:28</A><DD>But where <I>are</I> thy gods that thou hast made thee? let them arise, if they can save thee in the time of thy trouble: for <I>according to</I> the number of thy cities are thy gods, O Judah.
<DT><A NAME="2:29">2:29</A><DD>Wherefore will ye plead with me? ye all have transgressed against me, saith the LORD.
<DT><A NAME="2:30">2:30</A><DD>In vain have I smitten your children; they received no correction: your own sword hath devoured your prophets, like a destroying lion.
<DT><A NAME="2:31">2:31</A><DD>O generation, see ye the word of the LORD. Have I been a wilderness unto Israel? a land of darkness? wherefore say my people, We are lords; we will come no more unto thee?
<DT><A NAME="2:32">2:32</A><DD>Can a maid forget her ornaments, <I>or</I> a bride her attire? yet my people have forgotten me days without number.
<DT><A NAME="2:33">2:33</A><DD>Why trimmest thou thy way to seek love? therefore hast thou also taught the wicked ones thy ways.
<DT><A NAME="2:34">2:34</A><DD>Also in thy skirts is found the blood of the souls of the poor innocents: I have not found it by secret search, but upon all these.
<DT><A NAME="2:35">2:35</A><DD>Yet thou sayest, Because I am innocent, surely his anger shall turn from me. Behold, I will plead with thee, because thou sayest, I have not sinned.
<DT><A NAME="2:36">2:36</A><DD>Why gaddest thou about so much to change thy way? thou also shalt be ashamed of Egypt, as thou wast ashamed of Assyria.
<DT><A NAME="2:37">2:37</A><DD>Yea, thou shalt go forth from him, and thine hands upon thine head: for the LORD hath rejected thy confidences, and thou shalt not prosper in them.
</DL></DIV><H2>Chapter 3</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="3:1">3:1</A><DD>They say, If a man put away his wife, and she go from him, and become another man's, shall he return unto her again? shall not that land be greatly polluted? but thou hast played the harlot with many lovers; yet return again to me, saith the LORD.
<DT><A NAME="3:2">3:2</A><DD>Lift up thine eyes unto the high places, and see where thou hast not been lien with. In the ways hast thou sat for them, as the Arabian in the wilderness; and thou hast polluted the land with thy whoredoms and with thy wickedness.
<DT><A NAME="3:3">3:3</A><DD>Therefore the showers have been withholden, and there hath been no latter rain; and thou hadst a whore's forehead, thou refusedst to be ashamed.
<DT><A NAME="3:4">3:4</A><DD>Wilt thou not from this time cry unto me, My father, thou <I>art</I> the guide of my youth?
<DT><A NAME="3:5">3:5</A><DD>Will he reserve <I>his anger</I> for ever? will he keep <I>it</I> to the end? Behold, thou hast spoken and done evil things as thou couldest.
<DT><A NAME="3:6">3:6</A><DD>The LORD said also unto me in the days of Josiah the king, Hast thou seen <I>that</I> which backsliding Israel hath done? she is gone up upon every high mountain and under every green tree, and there hath played the harlot.
<DT><A NAME="3:7">3:7</A><DD>And I said after she had done all these <I>things</I>, Turn thou unto me. But she returned not. And her treacherous sister Judah saw <I>it</I>.
<DT><A NAME="3:8">3:8</A><DD>And I saw, when for all the causes whereby backsliding Israel committed adultery I had put her away, and given her a bill of divorce; yet her treacherous sister Judah feared not, but went and played the harlot also.
<DT><A NAME="3:9">3:9</A><DD>And it came to pass through the lightness of her whoredom, that she defiled the land, and committed adultery with stones and with stocks.
<DT><A NAME="3:10">3:10</A><DD>And yet for all this her treacherous sister Judah hath not turned unto me with her whole heart, but feignedly, saith the LORD.
<DT><A NAME="3:11">3:11</A><DD>And the LORD said unto me, The backsliding Israel hath justified herself more than treacherous Judah.
<DT><A NAME="3:12">3:12</A><DD>Go and proclaim these words toward the north, and say, Return, thou backsliding Israel, saith the LORD; <I>and</I> I will not cause mine anger to fall upon you: for I <I>am</I> merciful, saith the LORD, <I>and</I> I will not keep <I>anger</I> for ever.
<DT><A NAME="3:13">3:13</A><DD>Only acknowledge thine iniquity, that thou hast transgressed against the LORD thy God, and hast scattered thy ways to the strangers under every green tree, and ye have not obeyed my voice, saith the LORD.
<DT><A NAME="3:14">3:14</A><DD>Turn, O backsliding children, saith the LORD; for I am married unto you: and I will take you one of a city, and two of a family, and I will bring you to Zion:
<DT><A NAME="3:15">3:15</A><DD>And I will give you pastors according to mine heart, which shall feed you with knowledge and understanding.
<DT><A NAME="3:16">3:16</A><DD>And it shall come to pass, when ye be multiplied and increased in the land, in those days, saith the LORD, they shall say no more, The ark of the covenant of the LORD: neither shall it come to mind: neither shall they remember it; neither shall they visit <I>it</I>; neither shall <I>that</I> be done any more.
<DT><A NAME="3:17">3:17</A><DD>At that time they shall call Jerusalem the throne of the LORD; and all the nations shall be gathered unto it, to the name of the LORD, to Jerusalem: neither shall they walk any more after the imagination of their evil heart.
<DT><A NAME="3:18">3:18</A><DD>In those days the house of Judah shall walk with the house of Israel, and they shall come together out of the land of the north to the land that I have given for an inheritance unto your fathers.
<DT><A NAME="3:19">3:19</A><DD>But I said, How shall I put thee among the children, and give thee a pleasant land, a goodly heritage of the hosts of nations? and I said, Thou shalt call me, My father; and shalt not turn away from me.
<DT><A NAME="3:20">3:20</A><DD>Surely <I>as</I> a wife treacherously departeth from her husband, so have ye dealt treacherously with me, O house of Israel, saith the LORD.
<DT><A NAME="3:21">3:21</A><DD>A voice was heard upon the high places, weeping <I>and</I> supplications of the children of Israel: for they have perverted their way, <I>and</I> they have forgotten the LORD their God.
<DT><A NAME="3:22">3:22</A><DD>Return, ye backsliding children, <I>and</I> I will heal your backslidings. Behold, we come unto thee; for thou <I>art</I> the LORD our God.
<DT><A NAME="3:23">3:23</A><DD>Truly in vain <I>is salvation hoped for</I> from the hills, <I>and from</I> the multitude of mountains: truly in the LORD our God <I>is</I> the salvation of Israel.
<DT><A NAME="3:24">3:24</A><DD>For shame hath devoured the labour of our fathers from our youth; their flocks and their herds, their sons and their daughters.
<DT><A NAME="3:25">3:25</A><DD>We lie down in our shame, and our confusion covereth us: for we have sinned against the LORD our God, we and our fathers, from our youth even unto this day, and have not obeyed the voice of the LORD our God.

<DT><A NAME="4:1">4:1</A><DD>If thou wilt return, O Israel, saith the LORD, return unto me: and if thou wilt put away thine abominations out of my sight, then shalt thou not remove.
<DT><A NAME="4:2">4:2</A><DD>And thou shalt swear, The LORD liveth, in truth, in judgment, and in righteousness; and the nations shall bless themselves in him, and in him shall they glory.
<DT><A NAME="4:3">4:3</A><DD>For thus saith the LORD to the men of Judah and Jerusalem, Break up your fallow ground, and sow not among thorns.
<DT><A NAME="4:4">4:4</A><DD>Circumcise yourselves to the LORD, and take away the foreskins of your heart, ye men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem: lest my fury come forth like fire, and burn that none can quench <I>it</I>, because of the evil of your doings.
<DT><A NAME="4:5">4:5</A><DD>Declare ye in Judah, and publish in Jerusalem; and say, Blow ye the trumpet in the land: cry, gather together, and say, Assemble yourselves, and let us go into the defenced cities.
<DT><A NAME="4:6">4:6</A><DD>Set up the standard toward Zion: retire, stay not: for I will bring evil from the north, and a great destruction.
<DT><A NAME="4:7">4:7</A><DD>The lion is come up from his thicket, and the destroyer of the Gentiles is on his way; he is gone forth from his place to make thy land desolate; <I>and</I> thy cities shall be laid waste, without an inhabitant.
<DT><A NAME="4:8">4:8</A><DD>For this gird you with sackcloth, lament and howl: for the fierce anger of the LORD is not turned back from us.
<DT><A NAME="4:9">4:9</A><DD>And it shall come to pass at that day, saith the LORD, <I>that</I> the heart of the king shall perish, and the heart of the princes; and the priests shall be astonished, and the prophets shall wonder.
<DT><A NAME="4:10">4:10</A><DD>Then said I, Ah, Lord GOD! surely thou hast greatly deceived this people and Jerusalem, saying, Ye shall have peace; whereas the sword reacheth unto the soul.
<DT><A NAME="4:11">4:11</A><DD>At that time shall it be said to this people and to Jerusalem, A dry wind of the high places in the wilderness toward the daughter of my people, not to fan, nor to cleanse,
<DT><A NAME="4:12">4:12</A><DD><I>Even</I> a full wind from those <I>places</I> shall come unto me: now also will I give sentence against them.
<DT><A NAME="4:13">4:13</A><DD>Behold, he shall come up as clouds, and his chariots <I>shall be</I> as a whirlwind: his horses are swifter than eagles. Woe unto us! for we are spoiled.
<DT><A NAME="4:14">4:14</A><DD>O Jerusalem, wash thine heart from wickedness, that thou mayest be saved. How long shall thy vain thoughts lodge within thee?
<DT><A NAME="4:15">4:15</A><DD>For a voice declareth from Dan, and publisheth affliction from mount Ephraim.
<DT><A NAME="4:16">4:16</A><DD>Make ye mention to the nations; behold, publish against Jerusalem, <I>that</I> watchers come from a far country, and give out their voice against the cities of Judah.

<DT><A NAME="32:3">32:3</A><DD>For Zedekiah king of Judah had shut him up, saying, Wherefore dost thou prophesy, and say, Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall take it;
<DT><A NAME="32:4">32:4</A><DD>And Zedekiah king of Judah shall not escape out of the hand of the Chaldeans, but shall surely be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon, and shall speak with him mouth to mouth, and his eyes shall behold his eyes;

<DT><A NAME="32:6">32:6</A><DD>And Jeremiah said, The word of the LORD came unto me, saying,
<DT><A NAME="32:7">32:7</A><DD>Behold, Hanameel the son of Shallum thine uncle shall come unto thee, saying, Buy thee my field that <I>is</I> in Anathoth: for the right of redemption <I>is</I> thine to buy <I>it</I>.
<DT><A NAME="32:8">32:8</A><DD>So Hanameel mine uncle's son came to me in the court of the prison according to the word of the LORD, and said unto me, Buy my field, I pray thee, that <I>is</I> in Anathoth, which <I>is</I> in the country of Benjamin: for the right of inheritance <I>is</I> thine, and the redemption <I>is</I> thine; buy <I>it</I> for thyself.

<DT><A NAME="32:11">32:11</A><DD>So I took the evidence of the purchase, <I>both</I> that which was sealed <I>according</I> to the law and custom, and that which was open:
<DT><A NAME="32:12">32:12</A><DD>And I gave the evidence of the purchase unto Baruch the son of Neriah, the son of Maaseiah, in the sight of Hanameel mine uncle's <I>son</I>, and in the presence of the witnesses that subscribed the book of the purchase, before all the Jews that sat in the court of the prison.
<DT><A NAME="32:13">32:13</A><DD>And I charged Baruch before them, saying,

<DT><A NAME="32:32">32:32</A><DD>Because of all the evil of the children of Israel and of the children of Judah, which they have done to provoke me to anger, they, their kings, their princes, their priests, and their prophets, and the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.

<DT><A NAME="32:35">32:35</A><DD>And they built the high places of Baal, which <I>are</I> in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to cause their sons and their daughters to pass through <I>the fire</I> unto Molech; which I commanded them not, neither came it into my mind, that they should do this abomination, to cause Judah to sin.
<DT><A NAME="32:36">32:36</A><DD>And now therefore thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, concerning this city, whereof ye say, It shall be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence;
<DT><A NAME="32:37">32:37</A><DD>Behold, I will gather them out of all countries, whither I have driven them in mine anger, and in my fury, and in great wrath; and I will bring them again unto this place, and I will cause them to dwell safely:

<DT><A NAME="34:8">34:8</A><DD><I>This is</I> the word that came unto Jeremiah from the LORD, after that the king Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people which <I>were</I> at Jerusalem, to proclaim liberty unto them;

<DT><A NAME="34:11">34:11</A><DD>But afterward they turned, and caused the servants and the handmaids, whom they had let go free, to return, and brought them into subjection for servants and for handmaids.

<DT><A NAME="35:3">35:3</A><DD>Then I took Jaazaniah the son of Jeremiah, the son of Habaziniah, and his brethren, and all his sons, and the whole house of the Rechabites;

<DT><A NAME="35:8">35:8</A><DD>Thus have we obeyed the voice of Jonadab the son of Rechab our father in all that he hath charged us, to drink no wine all our days, we, our wives, our sons, nor our daughters;

<DT><A NAME="38:7">38:7</A><DD>Now when Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, one of the eunuchs which was in the king's house, heard that they had put Jeremiah in the dungeon; the king then sitting in the gate of Benjamin;

<DT><A NAME="38:9">38:9</A><DD>My lord the king, these men have done evil in all that they have done to Jeremiah the prophet, whom they have cast into the dungeon; and he is like to die for hunger in the place where he is: for <I>there is</I> no more bread in the city.
<DT><A NAME="38:10">38:10</A><DD>Then the king commanded Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, saying, Take from hence thirty men with thee, and take up Jeremiah the prophet out of the dungeon, before he die.
<DT><A NAME="38:11">38:11</A><DD>So Ebedmelech took the men with him, and went into the house of the king under the treasury, and took thence old cast clouts and old rotten rags, and let them down by cords into the dungeon to Jeremiah.
<DT><A NAME="38:12">38:12</A><DD>And Ebedmelech the Ethiopian said unto Jeremiah, Put now <I>these</I> old cast clouts and rotten rags under thine armholes under the cords. And Jeremiah did so.
<DT><A NAME="38:13">38:13</A><DD>So they drew up Jeremiah with cords, and took him up out of the dungeon: and Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison.
<DT><A NAME="38:14">38:14</A><DD>Then Zedekiah the king sent, and took Jeremiah the prophet unto him into the third entry that <I>is</I> in the house of the LORD: and the king said unto Jeremiah, I will ask thee a thing; hide nothing from me.
<DT><A NAME="38:15">38:15</A><DD>Then Jeremiah said unto Zedekiah, If I declare <I>it</I> unto thee, wilt thou not surely put me to death? and if I give thee counsel, wilt thou not hearken unto me?
<DT><A NAME="38:16">38:16</A><DD>So Zedekiah the king sware secretly unto Jeremiah, saying, <I>As</I> the LORD liveth, that made us this soul, I will not put thee to death, neither will I give thee into the hand of these men that seek thy life.
<DT><A NAME="38:17">38:17</A><DD>Then said Jeremiah unto Zedekiah, Thus saith the LORD, the God of hosts, the God of Israel; If thou wilt assuredly go forth unto the king of Babylon's princes, then thy soul shall live, and this city shall not be burned with fire; and thou shalt live, and thine house:
<DT><A NAME="38:18">38:18</A><DD>But if thou wilt not go forth to the king of Babylon's princes, then shall this city be given into the hand of the Chaldeans, and they shall burn it with fire, and thou shalt not escape out of their hand.
<DT><A NAME="38:19">38:19</A><DD>And Zedekiah the king said unto Jeremiah, I am afraid of the Jews that are fallen to the Chaldeans, lest they deliver me into their hand, and they mock me.
<DT><A NAME="38:20">38:20</A><DD>But Jeremiah said, They shall not deliver <I>thee</I>. Obey, I beseech thee, the voice of the LORD, which I speak unto thee: so it shall be well unto thee, and thy soul shall live.
<DT><A NAME="38:21">38:21</A><DD>But if thou refuse to go forth, this <I>is</I> the word that the LORD hath shewed me:
<DT><A NAME="38:22">38:22</A><DD>And, behold, all the women that are left in the king of Judah's house <I>shall be</I> brought forth to the king of Babylon's princes, and those <I>women</I> shall say, Thy friends have set thee on, and have prevailed against thee: thy feet are sunk in the mire, <I>and</I> they are turned away back.
<DT><A NAME="38:23">38:23</A><DD>So they shall bring out all thy wives and thy children to the Chaldeans: and thou shalt not escape out of their hand, but shalt be taken by the hand of the king of Babylon: and thou shalt cause this city to be burned with fire.
<DT><A NAME="38:24">38:24</A><DD>Then said Zedekiah unto Jeremiah, Let no man know of these words, and thou shalt not die.
<DT><A NAME="38:25">38:25</A><DD>But if the princes hear that I have talked with thee, and they come unto thee, and say unto thee, Declare unto us now what thou hast said unto the king, hide it not from us, and we will not put thee to death; also what the king said unto thee:
<DT><A NAME="38:26">38:26</A><DD>Then thou shalt say unto them, I presented my supplication before the king, that he would not cause me to return to Jonathan's house, to die there.
<DT><A NAME="38:27">38:27</A><DD>Then came all the princes unto Jeremiah, and asked him: and he told them according to all these words that the king had commanded. So they left off speaking with him; for the matter was not perceived.

<DT><A NAME="41:8">41:8</A><DD>But ten men were found among them that said unto Ishmael, Slay us not: for we have treasures in the field, of wheat, and of barley, and of oil, and of honey. So he forbare, and slew them not among their brethren.
<DT><A NAME="41:9">41:9</A><DD>Now the pit wherein Ishmael had cast all the dead bodies of the men, whom he had slain because of Gedaliah, <I>was</I> it which Asa the king had made for fear of Baasha king of Israel: <I>and</I> Ishmael the son of Nethaniah filled it with <I>them that were</I> slain.

<DT><A NAME="44:2">44:2</A><DD>Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Ye have seen all the evil that I have brought upon Jerusalem, and upon all the cities of Judah; and, behold, this day they <I>are</I> a desolation, and no man dwelleth therein,
<DT><A NAME="44:3">44:3</A><DD>Because of their wickedness which they have committed to provoke me to anger, in that they went to burn incense, <I>and</I> to serve other gods, whom they knew not, <I>neither</I> they, ye, nor your fathers.
<DT><A NAME="44:4">44:4</A><DD>Howbeit I sent unto you all my servants the prophets, rising early and sending <I>them</I>, saying, Oh, do not this abominable thing that I hate.
<DT><A NAME="44:5">44:5</A><DD>But they hearkened not, nor inclined their ear to turn from their wickedness, to burn no incense unto other gods.
<DT><A NAME="44:6">44:6</A><DD>Wherefore my fury and mine anger was poured forth, and was kindled in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem; and they are wasted <I>and</I> desolate, as at this day.
<DT><A NAME="44:7">44:7</A><DD>Therefore now thus saith the LORD, the God of hosts, the God of Israel; Wherefore commit ye <I>this</I> great evil against your souls, to cut off from you man and woman, child and suckling, out of Judah, to leave you none to remain;
<DT><A NAME="44:8">44:8</A><DD>In that ye provoke me unto wrath with the works of your hands, burning incense unto other gods in the land of Egypt, whither ye be gone to dwell, that ye might cut yourselves off, and that ye might be a curse and a reproach among all the nations of the earth?
<DT><A NAME="44:9">44:9</A><DD>Have ye forgotten the wickedness of your fathers, and the wickedness of the kings of Judah, and the wickedness of their wives, and your own wickedness, and the wickedness of your wives, which they have committed in the land of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem?
<DT><A NAME="44:10">44:10</A><DD>They are not humbled <I>even</I> unto this day, neither have they feared, nor walked in my law, nor in my statutes, that I set before you and before your fathers.
<DT><A NAME="44:11">44:11</A><DD>Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will set my face against you for evil, and to cut off all Judah.
<DT><A NAME="44:12">44:12</A><DD>And I will take the remnant of Judah, that have set their faces to go into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, and they shall all be consumed, <I>and</I> fall in the land of Egypt; they shall <I>even</I> be consumed by the sword <I>and</I> by the famine: they shall die, from the least even unto the greatest, by the sword and by the famine: and they shall be an execration, <I>and</I> an astonishment, and a curse, and a reproach.
<DT><A NAME="44:13">44:13</A><DD>For I will punish them that dwell in the land of Egypt, as I have punished Jerusalem, by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence:
<DT><A NAME="44:14">44:14</A><DD>So that none of the remnant of Judah, which are gone into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, shall escape or remain, that they should return into the land of Judah, to the which they have a desire to return to dwell there: for none shall return but such as shall escape.
<DT><A NAME="44:15">44:15</A><DD>Then all the men which knew that their wives had burned incense unto other gods, and all the women that stood by, a great multitude, even all the people that dwelt in the land of Egypt, in Pathros, answered Jeremiah, saying,
<DT><A NAME="44:16">44:16</A><DD><I>As for</I> the word that thou hast spoken unto us in the name of the LORD, we will not hearken unto thee.
<DT><A NAME="44:17">44:17</A><DD>But we will certainly do whatsoever thing goeth forth out of our own mouth, to burn incense unto the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto her, as we have done, we, and our fathers, our kings, and our princes, in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem: for <I>then</I> had we plenty of victuals, and were well, and saw no evil.
<DT><A NAME="44:18">44:18</A><DD>But since we left off to burn incense to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto her, we have wanted all <I>things</I>, and have been consumed by the sword and by the famine.
<DT><A NAME="44:19">44:19</A><DD>And when we burned incense to the queen of heaven, and poured out drink offerings unto her, did we make her cakes to worship her, and pour out drink offerings unto her, without our men?
<DT><A NAME="44:20">44:20</A><DD>Then Jeremiah said unto all the people, to the men, and to the women, and to all the people which had given him <I>that</I> answer, saying,
<DT><A NAME="44:21">44:21</A><DD>The incense that ye burned in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, ye, and your fathers, your kings, and your princes, and the people of the land, did not the LORD remember them, and came it <I>not</I> into his mind?
<DT><A NAME="44:22">44:22</A><DD>So that the LORD could no longer bear, because of the evil of your doings, <I>and</I> because of the abominations which ye have committed; therefore is your land a desolation, and an astonishment, and a curse, without an inhabitant, as at this day.
<DT><A NAME="44:23">44:23</A><DD>Because ye have burned incense, and because ye have sinned against the LORD, and have not obeyed the voice of the LORD, nor walked in his law, nor in his statutes, nor in his testimonies; therefore this evil is happened unto you, as at this day.
<DT><A NAME="44:24">44:24</A><DD>Moreover Jeremiah said unto all the people, and to all the women, Hear the word of the LORD, all Judah that <I>are</I> in the land of Egypt:
<DT><A NAME="44:25">44:25</A><DD>Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saying; Ye and your wives have both spoken with your mouths, and fulfilled with your hand, saying, We will surely perform our vows that we have vowed, to burn incense to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto her: ye will surely accomplish your vows, and surely perform your vows.
<DT><A NAME="44:26">44:26</A><DD>Therefore hear ye the word of the LORD, all Judah that dwell in the land of Egypt; Behold, I have sworn by my great name, saith the LORD, that my name shall no more be named in the mouth of any man of Judah in all the land of Egypt, saying, The Lord GOD liveth.
<DT><A NAME="44:27">44:27</A><DD>Behold, I will watch over them for evil, and not for good: and all the men of Judah that <I>are</I> in the land of Egypt shall be consumed by the sword and by the famine, until there be an end of them.
<DT><A NAME="44:28">44:28</A><DD>Yet a small number that escape the sword shall return out of the land of Egypt into the land of Judah, and all the remnant of Judah, that are gone into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, shall know whose words shall stand, mine, or theirs.
<DT><A NAME="44:29">44:29</A><DD>And this <I>shall be</I> a sign unto you, saith the LORD, that I will punish you in this place, that ye may know that my words shall surely stand against you for evil:
<DT><A NAME="44:30">44:30</A><DD>Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will give Pharaohhophra king of Egypt into the hand of his enemies, and into the hand of them that seek his life; as I gave Zedekiah king of Judah into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, his enemy, and that sought his life.
</DL></DIV><H2>Chapter 45</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="45:1">45:1</A><DD>The word that Jeremiah the prophet spake unto Baruch the son of Neriah, when he had written these words in a book at the mouth of Jeremiah, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, saying,
<DT><A NAME="45:2">45:2</A><DD>Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, unto thee, O Baruch;
<DT><A NAME="45:3">45:3</A><DD>Thou didst say, Woe is me now! for the LORD hath added grief to my sorrow; I fainted in my sighing, and I find no rest.
<DT><A NAME="45:4">45:4</A><DD>Thus shalt thou say unto him, The LORD saith thus; Behold, <I>that</I> which I have built will I break down, and that which I have planted I will pluck up, even this whole land.
<DT><A NAME="45:5">45:5</A><DD>And seekest thou great things for thyself? seek <I>them</I> not: for, behold, I will bring evil upon all flesh, saith the LORD: but thy life will I give unto thee for a prey in all places whither thou goest.

<DT><A NAME="46:1">46:1</A><DD>The word of the LORD which came to Jeremiah the prophet against the Gentiles;
<DT><A NAME="46:2">46:2</A><DD>Against Egypt, against the army of Pharaohnecho king of Egypt, which was by the river Euphrates in Carchemish, which Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon smote in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah.
<DT><A NAME="46:3">46:3</A><DD>Order ye the buckler and shield, and draw near to battle.
<DT><A NAME="46:4">46:4</A><DD>Harness the horses; and get up, ye horsemen, and stand forth with <I>your</I> helmets; furbish the spears, <I>and</I> put on the brigandines.
<DT><A NAME="46:5">46:5</A><DD>Wherefore have I seen them dismayed <I>and</I> turned away back? and their mighty ones are beaten down, and are fled apace, and look not back: <I>for</I> fear <I>was</I> round about, saith the LORD.
<DT><A NAME="46:6">46:6</A><DD>Let not the swift flee away, nor the mighty man escape; they shall stumble, and fall toward the north by the river Euphrates.
<DT><A NAME="46:7">46:7</A><DD>Who <I>is</I> this <I>that</I> cometh up as a flood, whose waters are moved as the rivers?
<DT><A NAME="46:8">46:8</A><DD>Egypt riseth up like a flood, and <I>his</I> waters are moved like the rivers; and he saith, I will go up, <I>and</I> will cover the earth; I will destroy the city and the inhabitants thereof.
<DT><A NAME="46:9">46:9</A><DD>Come up, ye horses; and rage, ye chariots; and let the mighty men come forth; the Ethiopians and the Libyans, that handle the shield; and the Lydians, that handle <I>and</I> bend the bow.
<DT><A NAME="46:10">46:10</A><DD>For this <I>is</I> the day of the Lord GOD of hosts, a day of vengeance, that he may avenge him of his adversaries: and the sword shall devour, and it shall be satiate and made drunk with their blood: for the Lord GOD of hosts hath a sacrifice in the north country by the river Euphrates.
<DT><A NAME="46:11">46:11</A><DD>Go up into Gilead, and take balm, O virgin, the daughter of Egypt: in vain shalt thou use many medicines; <I>for</I> thou shalt not be cured.
<DT><A NAME="46:12">46:12</A><DD>The nations have heard of thy shame, and thy cry hath filled the land: for the mighty man hath stumbled against the mighty, <I>and</I> they are fallen both together.
<DT><A NAME="46:13">46:13</A><DD>The word that the LORD spake to Jeremiah the prophet, how Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon should come <I>and</I> smite the land of Egypt.
<DT><A NAME="46:14">46:14</A><DD>Declare ye in Egypt, and publish in Migdol, and publish in Noph and in Tahpanhes: say ye, Stand fast, and prepare thee; for the sword shall devour round about thee.
<DT><A NAME="46:15">46:15</A><DD>Why are thy valiant <I>men</I> swept away? they stood not, because the LORD did drive them.
<DT><A NAME="46:16">46:16</A><DD>He made many to fall, yea, one fell upon another: and they said, Arise, and let us go again to our own people, and to the land of our nativity, from the oppressing sword.
<DT><A NAME="46:17">46:17</A><DD>They did cry there, Pharaoh king of Egypt <I>is but</I> a noise; he hath passed the time appointed.
<DT><A NAME="46:18">46:18</A><DD><I>As</I> I live, saith the King, whose name <I>is</I> the LORD of hosts, Surely as Tabor <I>is</I> among the mountains, and as Carmel by the sea, <I>so</I> shall he come.
<DT><A NAME="46:19">46:19</A><DD>O thou daughter dwelling in Egypt, furnish thyself to go into captivity: for Noph shall be waste and desolate without an inhabitant.
<DT><A NAME="46:20">46:20</A><DD>Egypt <I>is like</I> a very fair heifer, <I>but</I> destruction cometh; it cometh out of the north.
<DT><A NAME="46:21">46:21</A><DD>Also her hired men <I>are</I> in the midst of her like fatted bullocks; for they also are turned back, <I>and</I> are fled away together: they did not stand, because the day of their calamity was come upon them, <I>and</I> the time of their visitation.
<DT><A NAME="46:22">46:22</A><DD>The voice thereof shall go like a serpent; for they shall march with an army, and come against her with axes, as hewers of wood.
<DT><A NAME="46:23">46:23</A><DD>They shall cut down her forest, saith the LORD, though it cannot be searched; because they are more than the grasshoppers, and <I>are</I> innumerable.
<DT><A NAME="46:24">46:24</A><DD>The daughter of Egypt shall be confounded; she shall be delivered into the hand of the people of the north.

<DT><A NAME="47:3">47:3</A><DD>At the noise of the stamping of the hoofs of his strong <I>horses</I>, at the rushing of his chariots, <I>and at</I> the rumbling of his wheels, the fathers shall not look back to <I>their</I> children for feebleness of hands;
<DT><A NAME="47:4">47:4</A><DD>Because of the day that cometh to spoil all the Philistines, <I>and</I> to cut off from Tyrus and Zidon every helper that remaineth: for the LORD will spoil the Philistines, the remnant of the country of Caphtor.

<DT><A NAME="48:10">48:10</A><DD>Cursed <I>be</I> he that doeth the work of the LORD deceitfully, and cursed <I>be</I> he that keepeth back his sword from blood.
<DT><A NAME="48:11">48:11</A><DD>Moab hath been at ease from his youth, and he hath settled on his lees, and hath not been emptied from vessel to vessel, neither hath he gone into captivity: therefore his taste remained in him, and his scent is not changed.

<DT><A NAME="48:35">48:35</A><DD>Moreover I will cause to cease in Moab, saith the LORD, him that offereth in the high places, and him that burneth incense to his gods.
<DT><A NAME="48:36">48:36</A><DD>Therefore mine heart shall sound for Moab like pipes, and mine heart shall sound like pipes for the men of Kirheres: because the riches <I>that</I> he hath gotten are perished.

<DT><A NAME="48:41">48:41</A><DD>Kerioth is taken, and the strong holds are surprised, and the mighty men's hearts in Moab at that day shall be as the heart of a woman in her pangs.
<DT><A NAME="48:42">48:42</A><DD>And Moab shall be destroyed from <I>being</I> a people, because he hath magnified <I>himself</I> against the LORD.
<DT><A NAME="48:43">48:43</A><DD>Fear, and the pit, and the snare, <I>shall be</I> upon thee, O inhabitant of Moab, saith the LORD.
<DT><A NAME="48:44">48:44</A><DD>He that fleeth from the fear shall fall into the pit; and he that getteth up out of the pit shall be taken in the snare: for I will bring upon it, <I>even</I> upon Moab, the year of their visitation, saith the LORD.
<DT><A NAME="48:45">48:45</A><DD>They that fled stood under the shadow of Heshbon because of the force: but a fire shall come forth out of Heshbon, and a flame from the midst of Sihon, and shall devour the corner of Moab, and the crown of the head of the tumultuous ones.
<DT><A NAME="48:46">48:46</A><DD>Woe be unto thee, O Moab! the people of Chemosh perisheth: for thy sons are taken captives, and thy daughters captives.
<DT><A NAME="48:47">48:47</A><DD>Yet will I bring again the captivity of Moab in the latter days, saith the LORD. Thus far <I>is</I> the judgment of Moab.

<DT><A NAME="51:44">51:44</A><DD>And I will punish Bel in Babylon, and I will bring forth out of his mouth that which he hath swallowed up: and the nations shall not flow together any more unto him: yea, the wall of Babylon shall fall.
<DT><A NAME="51:45">51:45</A><DD>My people, go ye out of the midst of her, and deliver ye every man his soul from the fierce anger of the LORD.
<DT><A NAME="51:46">51:46</A><DD>And lest your heart faint, and ye fear for the rumour that shall be heard in the land; a rumour shall both come <I>one</I> year, and after that in <I>another</I> year <I>shall come</I> a rumour, and violence in the land, ruler against ruler.
<DT><A NAME="51:47">51:47</A><DD>Therefore, behold, the days come, that I will do judgment upon the graven images of Babylon: and her whole land shall be confounded, and all her slain shall fall in the midst of her.
<DT><A NAME="51:48">51:48</A><DD>Then the heaven and the earth, and all that <I>is</I> therein, shall sing for Babylon: for the spoilers shall come unto her from the north, saith the LORD.
<DT><A NAME="51:49">51:49</A><DD>As Babylon <I>hath caused</I> the slain of Israel to fall, so at Babylon shall fall the slain of all the earth.
<DT><A NAME="51:50">51:50</A><DD>Ye that have escaped the sword, go away, stand not still: remember the LORD afar off, and let Jerusalem come into your mind.
<DT><A NAME="51:51">51:51</A><DD>We are confounded, because we have heard reproach: shame hath covered our faces: for strangers are come into the sanctuaries of the LORD'S house.
<DT><A NAME="51:52">51:52</A><DD>Wherefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will do judgment upon her graven images: and through all her land the wounded shall groan.
<DT><A NAME="51:53">51:53</A><DD>Though Babylon should mount up to heaven, and though she should fortify the height of her strength, <I>yet</I> from me shall spoilers come unto her, saith the LORD.
<DT><A NAME="51:54">51:54</A><DD>A sound of a cry <I>cometh</I> from Babylon, and great destruction from the land of the Chaldeans:
<DT><A NAME="51:55">51:55</A><DD>Because the LORD hath spoiled Babylon, and destroyed out of her the great voice; when her waves do roar like great waters, a noise of their voice is uttered:
<DT><A NAME="51:56">51:56</A><DD>Because the spoiler is come upon her, <I>even</I> upon Babylon, and her mighty men are taken, every one of their bows is broken: for the LORD God of recompences shall surely requite.
<DT><A NAME="51:57">51:57</A><DD>And I will make drunk her princes, and her wise <I>men</I>, her captains, and her rulers, and her mighty men: and they shall sleep a perpetual sleep, and not wake, saith the King, whose name <I>is</I> the LORD of hosts.
<DT><A NAME="51:58">51:58</A><DD>Thus saith the LORD of hosts; The broad walls of Babylon shall be utterly broken, and her high gates shall be burned with fire; and the people shall labour in vain, and the folk in the fire, and they shall be weary.
<DT><A NAME="51:59">51:59</A><DD>The word which Jeremiah the prophet commanded Seraiah the son of Neriah, the son of Maaseiah, when he went with Zedekiah the king of Judah into Babylon in the fourth year of his reign. And <I>this</I> Seraiah <I>was</I> a quiet prince.
<DT><A NAME="51:60">51:60</A><DD>So Jeremiah wrote in a book all the evil that should come upon Babylon, <I>even</I> all these words that are written against Babylon.
<DT><A NAME="51:61">51:61</A><DD>And Jeremiah said to Seraiah, When thou comest to Babylon, and shalt see, and shalt read all these words;
<DT><A NAME="51:62">51:62</A><DD>Then shalt thou say, O LORD, thou hast spoken against this place, to cut it off, that none shall remain in it, neither man nor beast, but that it shall be desolate for ever.
<DT><A NAME="51:63">51:63</A><DD>And it shall be, when thou hast made an end of reading this book, <I>that</I> thou shalt bind a stone to it, and cast it into the midst of Euphrates:
<DT><A NAME="51:64">51:64</A><DD>And thou shalt say, Thus shall Babylon sink, and shall not rise from the evil that I will bring upon her: and they shall be weary. Thus far <I>are</I> the words of Jeremiah.
</DL></DIV><H2>Chapter 52</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="52:1">52:1</A><DD>Zedekiah <I>was</I> one and twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name <I>was</I> Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.
<DT><A NAME="52:2">52:2</A><DD>And he did <I>that which was</I> evil in the eyes of the LORD, according to all that Jehoiakim had done.
<DT><A NAME="52:3">52:3</A><DD>For through the anger of the LORD it came to pass in Jerusalem and Judah, till he had cast them out from his presence, that Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.
<DT><A NAME="52:4">52:4</A><DD>And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, in the tenth <I>day</I> of the month, <I>that</I> Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon came, he and all his army, against Jerusalem, and pitched against it, and built forts against it round about.
<DT><A NAME="52:5">52:5</A><DD>So the city was besieged unto the eleventh year of king Zedekiah.
<DT><A NAME="52:6">52:6</A><DD>And in the fourth month, in the ninth <I>day</I> of the month, the famine was sore in the city, so that there was no bread for the people of the land.
<DT><A NAME="52:7">52:7</A><DD>Then the city was broken up, and all the men of war fled, and went forth out of the city by night by the way of the gate between the two walls, which <I>was</I> by the king's garden; (now the Chaldeans <I>were</I> by the city round about:) and they went by the way of the plain.
<DT><A NAME="52:8">52:8</A><DD>But the army of the Chaldeans pursued after the king, and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho; and all his army was scattered from him.
<DT><A NAME="52:9">52:9</A><DD>Then they took the king, and carried him up unto the king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath; where he gave judgment upon him.
<DT><A NAME="52:10">52:10</A><DD>And the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes: he slew also all the princes of Judah in Riblah.
<DT><A NAME="52:11">52:11</A><DD>Then he put out the eyes of Zedekiah; and the king of Babylon bound him in chains, and carried him to Babylon, and put him in prison till the day of his death.
<DT><A NAME="52:12">52:12</A><DD>Now in the fifth month, in the tenth <I>day</I> of the month, which <I>was</I> the nineteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, came Nebuzaradan, captain of the guard, <I>which</I> served the king of Babylon, into Jerusalem,
<DT><A NAME="52:13">52:13</A><DD>And burned the house of the LORD, and the king's house; and all the houses of Jerusalem, and all the houses of the great <I>men</I>, burned he with fire:
<DT><A NAME="52:14">52:14</A><DD>And all the army of the Chaldeans, that <I>were</I> with the captain of the guard, brake down all the walls of Jerusalem round about.
<DT><A NAME="52:15">52:15</A><DD>Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive <I>certain</I> of the poor of the people, and the residue of the people that remained in the city, and those that fell away, that fell to the king of Babylon, and the rest of the multitude.
<DT><A NAME="52:16">52:16</A><DD>But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left <I>certain</I> of the poor of the land for vinedressers and for husbandmen.
<DT><A NAME="52:17">52:17</A><DD>Also the pillars of brass that <I>were</I> in the house of the LORD, and the bases, and the brasen sea that <I>was</I> in the house of the LORD, the Chaldeans brake, and carried all the brass of them to Babylon.
<DT><A NAME="52:18">52:18</A><DD>The caldrons also, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the bowls, and the spoons, and all the vessels of brass wherewith they ministered, took they away.
<DT><A NAME="52:19">52:19</A><DD>And the basons, and the firepans, and the bowls, and the caldrons, and the candlesticks, and the spoons, and the cups; <I>that</I> which <I>was</I> of gold <I>in</I> gold, and <I>that</I> which <I>was</I> of silver <I>in</I> silver, took the captain of the guard away.
<DT><A NAME="52:20">52:20</A><DD>The two pillars, one sea, and twelve brasen bulls that <I>were</I> under the bases, which king Solomon had made in the house of the LORD: the brass of all these vessels was without weight.
<DT><A NAME="52:21">52:21</A><DD>And <I>concerning</I> the pillars, the height of one pillar <I>was</I> eighteen cubits; and a fillet of twelve cubits did compass it; and the thickness thereof <I>was</I> four fingers: <I>it was</I> hollow.
<DT><A NAME="52:22">52:22</A><DD>And a chapiter of brass <I>was</I> upon it; and the height of one chapiter <I>was</I> five cubits, with network and pomegranates upon the chapiters round about, all <I>of</I> brass. The second pillar also and the pomegranates <I>were</I> like unto these.
<DT><A NAME="52:23">52:23</A><DD>And there were ninety and six pomegranates on a side; <I>and</I> all the pomegranates upon the network <I>were</I> an hundred round about.
<DT><A NAME="52:24">52:24</A><DD>And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the door:
<DT><A NAME="52:25">52:25</A><DD>He took also out of the city an eunuch, which had the charge of the men of war; and seven men of them that were near the king's person, which were found in the city; and the principal scribe of the host, who mustered the people of the land; and threescore men of the people of the land, that were found in the midst of the city.
<DT><A NAME="52:26">52:26</A><DD>So Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them, and brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah.
<DT><A NAME="52:27">52:27</A><DD>And the king of Babylon smote them, and put them to death in Riblah in the land of Hamath. Thus Judah was carried away captive out of his own land.
<DT><A NAME="52:28">52:28</A><DD>This <I>is</I> the people whom Nebuchadrezzar carried away captive: in the seventh year three thousand Jews and three and twenty:
<DT><A NAME="52:29">52:29</A><DD>In the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar he carried away captive from Jerusalem eight hundred thirty and two persons:
<DT><A NAME="52:30">52:30</A><DD>In the three and twentieth year of Nebuchadrezzar Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive of the Jews seven hundred forty and five persons: all the persons <I>were</I> four thousand and six hundred.
<DT><A NAME="52:31">52:31</A><DD>And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, in the five and twentieth <I>day</I> of the month, <I>that</I> Evilmerodach king of Babylon in the <I>first</I> year of his reign lifted up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah, and brought him forth out of prison,
<DT><A NAME="52:32">52:32</A><DD>And spake kindly unto him, and set his throne above the throne of the kings that <I>were</I> with him in Babylon,
<DT><A NAME="52:33">52:33</A><DD>And changed his prison garments: and he did continually eat bread before him all the days of his life.
<DT><A NAME="52:34">52:34</A><DD>And <I>for</I> his diet, there was a continual diet given him of the king of Babylon, every day a portion until the day of his death, all the days of his life.
