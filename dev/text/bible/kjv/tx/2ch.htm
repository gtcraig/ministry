<H2>Chapter 1</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="1:1">1:1</A><DD>And Solomon the son of David was strengthened in his kingdom, and the LORD his God <I>was</I> with him, and magnified him exceedingly.
<DT><A NAME="1:2">1:2</A><DD>Then Solomon spake unto all Israel, to the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and to the judges, and to every governor in all Israel, the chief of the fathers.
<DT><A NAME="1:3">1:3</A><DD>So Solomon, and all the congregation with him, went to the high place that <I>was</I> at Gibeon; for there was the tabernacle of the congregation of God, which Moses the servant of the LORD had made in the wilderness.
<DT><A NAME="1:4">1:4</A><DD>But the ark of God had David brought up from Kirjathjearim to <I>the place which</I> David had prepared for it: for he had pitched a tent for it at Jerusalem.
<DT><A NAME="1:5">1:5</A><DD>Moreover the brasen altar, that Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, had made, he put before the tabernacle of the LORD: and Solomon and the congregation sought unto it.
<DT><A NAME="1:6">1:6</A><DD>And Solomon went up thither to the brasen altar before the LORD, which <I>was</I> at the tabernacle of the congregation, and offered a thousand burnt offerings upon it.
<DT><A NAME="1:7">1:7</A><DD>In that night did God appear unto Solomon, and said unto him, Ask what I shall give thee.
<DT><A NAME="1:8">1:8</A><DD>And Solomon said unto God, Thou hast shewed great mercy unto David my father, and hast made me to reign in his stead.
<DT><A NAME="1:9">1:9</A><DD>Now, O LORD God, let thy promise unto David my father be established: for thou hast made me king over a people like the dust of the earth in multitude.
<DT><A NAME="1:10">1:10</A><DD>Give me now wisdom and knowledge, that I may go out and come in before this people: for who can judge this thy people, <I>that is so</I> great?
<DT><A NAME="1:11">1:11</A><DD>And God said to Solomon, Because this was in thine heart, and thou hast not asked riches, wealth, or honour, nor the life of thine enemies, neither yet hast asked long life; but hast asked wisdom and knowledge for thyself, that thou mayest judge my people, over whom I have made thee king:
<DT><A NAME="1:12">1:12</A><DD>Wisdom and knowledge <I>is</I> granted unto thee; and I will give thee riches, and wealth, and honour, such as none of the kings have had that <I>have been</I> before thee, neither shall there any after thee have the like.
<DT><A NAME="1:13">1:13</A><DD>Then Solomon came <I>from his journey</I> to the high place that <I>was</I> at Gibeon to Jerusalem, from before the tabernacle of the congregation, and reigned over Israel.
<DT><A NAME="1:14">1:14</A><DD>And Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen: and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, which he placed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem.
<DT><A NAME="1:15">1:15</A><DD>And the king made silver and gold at Jerusalem <I>as plenteous</I> as stones, and cedar trees made he as the sycomore trees that <I>are</I> in the vale for abundance.
<DT><A NAME="1:16">1:16</A><DD>And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and linen yarn: the king's merchants received the linen yarn at a price.
<DT><A NAME="1:17">1:17</A><DD>And they fetched up, and brought forth out of Egypt a chariot for six hundred <I>shekels</I> of silver, and an horse for an hundred and fifty: and so brought they out <I>horses</I> for all the kings of the Hittites, and for the kings of Syria, by their means.
</DL></DIV><H2>Chapter 2</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="2:1">2:1</A><DD>And Solomon determined to build an house for the name of the LORD, and an house for his kingdom.
<DT><A NAME="2:2">2:2</A><DD>And Solomon told out threescore and ten thousand men to bear burdens, and fourscore thousand to hew in the mountain, and three thousand and six hundred to oversee them.
<DT><A NAME="2:3">2:3</A><DD>And Solomon sent to Huram the king of Tyre, saying, As thou didst deal with David my father, and didst send him cedars to build him an house to dwell therein, <I>even so deal with me</I>.
<DT><A NAME="2:4">2:4</A><DD>Behold, I build an house to the name of the LORD my God, to dedicate <I>it</I> to him, <I>and</I> to burn before him sweet incense, and for the continual shewbread, and for the burnt offerings morning and evening, on the sabbaths, and on the new moons, and on the solemn feasts of the LORD our God. This <I>is an ordinance</I> for ever to Israel.
<DT><A NAME="2:5">2:5</A><DD>And the house which I build <I>is</I> great: for great <I>is</I> our God above all gods.
<DT><A NAME="2:6">2:6</A><DD>But who is able to build him an house, seeing the heaven and heaven of heavens cannot contain him? who <I>am</I> I then, that I should build him an house, save only to burn sacrifice before him?
<DT><A NAME="2:7">2:7</A><DD>Send me now therefore a man cunning to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass, and in iron, and in purple, and crimson, and blue, and that can skill to grave with the cunning men that <I>are</I> with me in Judah and in Jerusalem, whom David my father did provide.
<DT><A NAME="2:8">2:8</A><DD>Send me also cedar trees, fir trees, and algum trees, out of Lebanon: for I know that thy servants can skill to cut timber in Lebanon; and, behold, my servants <I>shall be</I> with thy servants,
<DT><A NAME="2:9">2:9</A><DD>Even to prepare me timber in abundance: for the house which I am about to build <I>shall be</I> wonderful great.
<DT><A NAME="2:10">2:10</A><DD>And, behold, I will give to thy servants, the hewers that cut timber, twenty thousand measures of beaten wheat, and twenty thousand measures of barley, and twenty thousand baths of wine, and twenty thousand baths of oil.
<DT><A NAME="2:11">2:11</A><DD>Then Huram the king of Tyre answered in writing, which he sent to Solomon, Because the LORD hath loved his people, he hath made thee king over them.
<DT><A NAME="2:12">2:12</A><DD>Huram said moreover, Blessed <I>be</I> the LORD God of Israel, that made heaven and earth, who hath given to David the king a wise son, endued with prudence and understanding, that might build an house for the LORD, and an house for his kingdom.
<DT><A NAME="2:13">2:13</A><DD>And now I have sent a cunning man, endued with understanding, of Huram my father's,
<DT><A NAME="2:14">2:14</A><DD>The son of a woman of the daughters of Dan, and his father <I>was</I> a man of Tyre, skilful to work in gold, and in silver, in brass, in iron, in stone, and in timber, in purple, in blue, and in fine linen, and in crimson; also to grave any manner of graving, and to find out every device which shall be put to him, with thy cunning men, and with the cunning men of my lord David thy father.
<DT><A NAME="2:15">2:15</A><DD>Now therefore the wheat, and the barley, the oil, and the wine, which my lord hath spoken of, let him send unto his servants:
<DT><A NAME="2:16">2:16</A><DD>And we will cut wood out of Lebanon, as much as thou shalt need: and we will bring it to thee in floats by sea to Joppa; and thou shalt carry it up to Jerusalem.
<DT><A NAME="2:17">2:17</A><DD>And Solomon numbered all the strangers that <I>were</I> in the land of Israel, after the numbering wherewith David his father had numbered them; and they were found an hundred and fifty thousand and three thousand and six hundred.
<DT><A NAME="2:18">2:18</A><DD>And he set threescore and ten thousand of them <I>to be</I> bearers of burdens, and fourscore thousand <I>to be</I> hewers in the mountain, and three thousand and six hundred overseers to set the people a work.
</DL></DIV><H2>Chapter 3</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="3:1">3:1</A><DD>Then Solomon began to build the house of the LORD at Jerusalem in mount Moriah, where <I>the LORD</I> appeared unto David his father, in the place that David had prepared in the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite.
<DT><A NAME="3:2">3:2</A><DD>And he began to build in the second <I>day</I> of the second month, in the fourth year of his reign.
<DT><A NAME="3:3">3:3</A><DD>Now these <I>are the things wherein</I> Solomon was instructed for the building of the house of God. The length by cubits after the first measure <I>was</I> threescore cubits, and the breadth twenty cubits.
<DT><A NAME="3:4">3:4</A><DD>And the porch that <I>was</I> in the front <I>of the house</I>, the length <I>of it was</I> according to the breadth of the house, twenty cubits, and the height <I>was</I> an hundred and twenty: and he overlaid it within with pure gold.
<DT><A NAME="3:5">3:5</A><DD>And the greater house he cieled with fir tree, which he overlaid with fine gold, and set thereon palm trees and chains.
<DT><A NAME="3:6">3:6</A><DD>And he garnished the house with precious stones for beauty: and the gold <I>was</I> gold of Parvaim.
<DT><A NAME="3:7">3:7</A><DD>He overlaid also the house, the beams, the posts, and the walls thereof, and the doors thereof, with gold; and graved cherubims on the walls.
<DT><A NAME="3:8">3:8</A><DD>And he made the most holy house, the length whereof <I>was</I> according to the breadth of the house, twenty cubits, and the breadth thereof twenty cubits: and he overlaid it with fine gold, <I>amounting</I> to six hundred talents.
<DT><A NAME="3:9">3:9</A><DD>And the weight of the nails <I>was</I> fifty shekels of gold. And he overlaid the upper chambers with gold.
<DT><A NAME="3:10">3:10</A><DD>And in the most holy house he made two cherubims of image work, and overlaid them with gold.
<DT><A NAME="3:11">3:11</A><DD>And the wings of the cherubims <I>were</I> twenty cubits long: one wing <I>of the one cherub was</I> five cubits, reaching to the wall of the house: and the other wing <I>was likewise</I> five cubits, reaching to the wing of the other cherub.
<DT><A NAME="3:12">3:12</A><DD>And <I>one</I> wing of the other cherub <I>was</I> five cubits, reaching to the wall of the house: and the other wing <I>was</I> five cubits <I>also</I>, joining to the wing of the other cherub.
<DT><A NAME="3:13">3:13</A><DD>The wings of these cherubims spread themselves forth twenty cubits: and they stood on their feet, and their faces <I>were</I> inward.
<DT><A NAME="3:14">3:14</A><DD>And he made the vail <I>of</I> blue, and purple, and crimson, and fine linen, and wrought cherubims thereon.
<DT><A NAME="3:15">3:15</A><DD>Also he made before the house two pillars of thirty and five cubits high, and the chapiter that <I>was</I> on the top of each of them <I>was</I> five cubits.
<DT><A NAME="3:16">3:16</A><DD>And he made chains, <I>as</I> in the oracle, and put <I>them</I> on the heads of the pillars; and made an hundred pomegranates, and put <I>them</I> on the chains.
<DT><A NAME="3:17">3:17</A><DD>And he reared up the pillars before the temple, one on the right hand, and the other on the left; and called the name of that on the right hand Jachin, and the name of that on the left Boaz.
</DL></DIV><H2>Chapter 4</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="4:1">4:1</A><DD>Moreover he made an altar of brass, twenty cubits the length thereof, and twenty cubits the breadth thereof, and ten cubits the height thereof.
<DT><A NAME="4:2">4:2</A><DD>Also he made a molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim, round in compass, and five cubits the height thereof; and a line of thirty cubits did compass it round about.
<DT><A NAME="4:3">4:3</A><DD>And under it <I>was</I> the similitude of oxen, which did compass it round about: ten in a cubit, compassing the sea round about. Two rows of oxen <I>were</I> cast, when it was cast.
<DT><A NAME="4:4">4:4</A><DD>It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east: and the sea <I>was set</I> above upon them, and all their hinder parts <I>were</I> inward.
<DT><A NAME="4:5">4:5</A><DD>And the thickness of it <I>was</I> an handbreadth, and the brim of it like the work of the brim of a cup, with flowers of lilies; <I>and</I> it received and held three thousand baths.
<DT><A NAME="4:6">4:6</A><DD>He made also ten lavers, and put five on the right hand, and five on the left, to wash in them: such things as they offered for the burnt offering they washed in them; but the sea <I>was</I> for the priests to wash in.
<DT><A NAME="4:7">4:7</A><DD>And he made ten candlesticks of gold according to their form, and set <I>them</I> in the temple, five on the right hand, and five on the left.
<DT><A NAME="4:8">4:8</A><DD>He made also ten tables, and placed <I>them</I> in the temple, five on the right side, and five on the left. And he made an hundred basons of gold.
<DT><A NAME="4:9">4:9</A><DD>Furthermore he made the court of the priests, and the great court, and doors for the court, and overlaid the doors of them with brass.
<DT><A NAME="4:10">4:10</A><DD>And he set the sea on the right side of the east end, over against the south.
<DT><A NAME="4:11">4:11</A><DD>And Huram made the pots, and the shovels, and the basons. And Huram finished the work that he was to make for king Solomon for the house of God;
<DT><A NAME="4:12">4:12</A><DD><I>To wit</I>, the two pillars, and the pommels, and the chapiters <I>which were</I> on the top of the two pillars, and the two wreaths to cover the two pommels of the chapiters which <I>were</I> on the top of the pillars;
<DT><A NAME="4:13">4:13</A><DD>And four hundred pomegranates on the two wreaths; two rows of pomegranates on each wreath, to cover the two pommels of the chapiters which <I>were</I> upon the pillars.
<DT><A NAME="4:14">4:14</A><DD>He made also bases, and lavers made he upon the bases;
<DT><A NAME="4:15">4:15</A><DD>One sea, and twelve oxen under it.
<DT><A NAME="4:16">4:16</A><DD>The pots also, and the shovels, and the fleshhooks, and all their instruments, did Huram his father make to king Solomon for the house of the LORD of bright brass.
<DT><A NAME="4:17">4:17</A><DD>In the plain of Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zeredathah.
<DT><A NAME="4:18">4:18</A><DD>Thus Solomon made all these vessels in great abundance: for the weight of the brass could not be found out.
<DT><A NAME="4:19">4:19</A><DD>And Solomon made all the vessels that <I>were for</I> the house of God, the golden altar also, and the tables whereon the shewbread <I>was set</I>;
<DT><A NAME="4:20">4:20</A><DD>Moreover the candlesticks with their lamps, that they should burn after the manner before the oracle, of pure gold;
<DT><A NAME="4:21">4:21</A><DD>And the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs, <I>made he of</I> gold, <I>and</I> that perfect gold;
<DT><A NAME="4:22">4:22</A><DD>And the snuffers, and the basons, and the spoons, and the censers, <I>of</I> pure gold: and the entry of the house, the inner doors thereof for the most holy <I>place</I>, and the doors of the house of the temple, <I>were of</I> gold.
</DL></DIV><H2>Chapter 5</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="5:1">5:1</A><DD>Thus all the work that Solomon made for the house of the LORD was finished: and Solomon brought in <I>all</I> the things that David his father had dedicated; and the silver, and the gold, and all the instruments, put he among the treasures of the house of God.
<DT><A NAME="5:2">5:2</A><DD>Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, the chief of the fathers of the children of Israel, unto Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of the city of David, which <I>is</I> Zion.
<DT><A NAME="5:3">5:3</A><DD>Wherefore all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto the king in the feast which <I>was</I> in the seventh month.
<DT><A NAME="5:4">5:4</A><DD>And all the elders of Israel came; and the Levites took up the ark.
<DT><A NAME="5:5">5:5</A><DD>And they brought up the ark, and the tabernacle of the congregation, and all the holy vessels that <I>were</I> in the tabernacle, these did the priests <I>and</I> the Levites bring up.
<DT><A NAME="5:6">5:6</A><DD>Also king Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel that were assembled unto him before the ark, sacrificed sheep and oxen, which could not be told nor numbered for multitude.
<DT><A NAME="5:7">5:7</A><DD>And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the LORD unto his place, to the oracle of the house, into the most holy <I>place, even</I> under the wings of the cherubims:
<DT><A NAME="5:8">5:8</A><DD>For the cherubims spread forth <I>their</I> wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubims covered the ark and the staves thereof above.
<DT><A NAME="5:9">5:9</A><DD>And they drew out the staves <I>of the ark</I>, that the ends of the staves were seen from the ark before the oracle; but they were not seen without. And there it is unto this day.
<DT><A NAME="5:10">5:10</A><DD><I>There was</I> nothing in the ark save the two tables which Moses put <I>therein</I> at Horeb, when the LORD made <I>a covenant</I> with the children of Israel, when they came out of Egypt.
<DT><A NAME="5:11">5:11</A><DD>And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy <I>place</I>: (for all the priests <I>that were</I> present were sanctified, <I>and</I> did not <I>then</I> wait by course:
<DT><A NAME="5:12">5:12</A><DD>Also the Levites <I>which were</I> the singers, all of them of Asaph, of Heman, of Jeduthun, with their sons and their brethren, <I>being</I> arrayed in white linen, having cymbals and psalteries and harps, stood at the east end of the altar, and with them an hundred and twenty priests sounding with trumpets:)
<DT><A NAME="5:13">5:13</A><DD>It came even to pass, as the trumpeters and singers <I>were</I> as one, to make one sound to be heard in praising and thanking the LORD; and when they lifted up <I>their</I> voice with the trumpets and cymbals and instruments of musick, and praised the LORD, <I>saying</I>, For <I>he is</I> good; for his mercy <I>endureth</I> for ever: that <I>then</I> the house was filled with a cloud, <I>even</I> the house of the LORD;
<DT><A NAME="5:14">5:14</A><DD>So that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud: for the glory of the LORD had filled the house of God.
</DL></DIV><H2>Chapter 6</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="6:1">6:1</A><DD>Then said Solomon, The LORD hath said that he would dwell in the thick darkness.
<DT><A NAME="6:2">6:2</A><DD>But I have built an house of habitation for thee, and a place for thy dwelling for ever.
<DT><A NAME="6:3">6:3</A><DD>And the king turned his face, and blessed the whole congregation of Israel: and all the congregation of Israel stood.
<DT><A NAME="6:4">6:4</A><DD>And he said, Blessed <I>be</I> the LORD God of Israel, who hath with his hands fulfilled <I>that</I> which he spake with his mouth to my father David, saying,
<DT><A NAME="6:5">6:5</A><DD>Since the day that I brought forth my people out of the land of Egypt I chose no city among all the tribes of Israel to build an house in, that my name might be there; neither chose I any man to be a ruler over my people Israel:
<DT><A NAME="6:6">6:6</A><DD>But I have chosen Jerusalem, that my name might be there; and have chosen David to be over my people Israel.
<DT><A NAME="6:7">6:7</A><DD>Now it was in the heart of David my father to build an house for the name of the LORD God of Israel.
<DT><A NAME="6:8">6:8</A><DD>But the LORD said to David my father, Forasmuch as it was in thine heart to build an house for my name, thou didst well in that it was in thine heart:

<DT><A NAME="7:1">7:1</A><DD>Now when Solomon had made an end of praying, the fire came down from heaven, and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices; and the glory of the LORD filled the house.
<DT><A NAME="7:2">7:2</A><DD>And the priests could not enter into the house of the LORD, because the glory of the LORD had filled the LORD'S house.
<DT><A NAME="7:3">7:3</A><DD>And when all the children of Israel saw how the fire came down, and the glory of the LORD upon the house, they bowed themselves with their faces to the ground upon the pavement, and worshipped, and praised the LORD, <I>saying</I>, For <I>he is</I> good; for his mercy <I>endureth</I> for ever.
<DT><A NAME="7:4">7:4</A><DD>Then the king and all the people offered sacrifices before the LORD.
<DT><A NAME="7:5">7:5</A><DD>And king Solomon offered a sacrifice of twenty and two thousand oxen, and an hundred and twenty thousand sheep: so the king and all the people dedicated the house of God.

<DT><A NAME="7:7">7:7</A><DD>Moreover Solomon hallowed the middle of the court that <I>was</I> before the house of the LORD: for there he offered burnt offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings, because the brasen altar which Solomon had made was not able to receive the burnt offerings, and the meat offerings, and the fat.

<DT><A NAME="8:11">8:11</A><DD>And Solomon brought up the daughter of Pharaoh out of the city of David unto the house that he had built for her: for he said, My wife shall not dwell in the house of David king of Israel, because <I>the places are</I> holy, whereunto the ark of the LORD hath come.
<DT><A NAME="8:12">8:12</A><DD>Then Solomon offered burnt offerings unto the LORD on the altar of the LORD, which he had built before the porch,

<DT><A NAME="11:4">11:4</A><DD>Thus saith the LORD, Ye shall not go up, nor fight against your brethren: return every man to his house: for this thing is done of me. And they obeyed the words of the LORD, and returned from going against Jeroboam.
<DT><A NAME="11:5">11:5</A><DD>And Rehoboam dwelt in Jerusalem, and built cities for defence in Judah.
<DT><A NAME="11:6">11:6</A><DD>He built even Bethlehem, and Etam, and Tekoa,

<DT><A NAME="11:11">11:11</A><DD>And he fortified the strong holds, and put captains in them, and store of victual, and of oil and wine.
<DT><A NAME="11:12">11:12</A><DD>And in every several city <I>he put</I> shields and spears, and made them exceeding strong, having Judah and Benjamin on his side.
<DT><A NAME="11:13">11:13</A><DD>And the priests and the Levites that <I>were</I> in all Israel resorted to him out of all their coasts.
<DT><A NAME="11:14">11:14</A><DD>For the Levites left their suburbs and their possession, and came to Judah and Jerusalem: for Jeroboam and his sons had cast them off from executing the priest's office unto the LORD:
<DT><A NAME="11:15">11:15</A><DD>And he ordained him priests for the high places, and for the devils, and for the calves which he had made.
<DT><A NAME="11:16">11:16</A><DD>And after them out of all the tribes of Israel such as set their hearts to seek the LORD God of Israel came to Jerusalem, to sacrifice unto the LORD God of their fathers.
<DT><A NAME="11:17">11:17</A><DD>So they strengthened the kingdom of Judah, and made Rehoboam the son of Solomon strong, three years: for three years they walked in the way of David and Solomon.
<DT><A NAME="11:18">11:18</A><DD>And Rehoboam took him Mahalath the daughter of Jerimoth the son of David to wife, <I>and</I> Abihail the daughter of Eliab the son of Jesse;

<DT><A NAME="11:22">11:22</A><DD>And Rehoboam made Abijah the son of Maachah the chief, <I>to be</I> ruler among his brethren: for <I>he thought</I> to make him king.
<DT><A NAME="11:23">11:23</A><DD>And he dealt wisely, and dispersed of all his children throughout all the countries of Judah and Benjamin, unto every fenced city: and he gave them victual in abundance. And he desired many wives.

<DT><A NAME="12:1">12:1</A><DD>And it came to pass, when Rehoboam had established the kingdom, and had strengthened himself, he forsook the law of the LORD, and all Israel with him.
<DT><A NAME="12:2">12:2</A><DD>And it came to pass, <I>that</I> in the fifth year of king Rehoboam Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, because they had transgressed against the LORD,
<DT><A NAME="12:3">12:3</A><DD>With twelve hundred chariots, and threescore thousand horsemen: and the people <I>were</I> without number that came with him out of Egypt; the Lubims, the Sukkiims, and the Ethiopians.
<DT><A NAME="12:4">12:4</A><DD>And he took the fenced cities which <I>pertained</I> to Judah, and came to Jerusalem.
<DT><A NAME="12:5">12:5</A><DD>Then came Shemaiah the prophet to Rehoboam, and <I>to</I> the princes of Judah, that were gathered together to Jerusalem because of Shishak, and said unto them, Thus saith the LORD, Ye have forsaken me, and therefore have I also left you in the hand of Shishak.
<DT><A NAME="12:6">12:6</A><DD>Whereupon the princes of Israel and the king humbled themselves; and they said, The LORD <I>is</I> righteous.
<DT><A NAME="12:7">12:7</A><DD>And when the LORD saw that they humbled themselves, the word of the LORD came to Shemaiah, saying, They have humbled themselves; <I>therefore</I> I will not destroy them, but I will grant them some deliverance; and my wrath shall not be poured out upon Jerusalem by the hand of Shishak.
<DT><A NAME="12:8">12:8</A><DD>Nevertheless they shall be his servants; that they may know my service, and the service of the kingdoms of the countries.
<DT><A NAME="12:9">12:9</A><DD>So Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, and took away the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king's house; he took all: he carried away also the shields of gold which Solomon had made.
<DT><A NAME="12:10">12:10</A><DD>Instead of which king Rehoboam made shields of brass, and committed <I>them</I> to the hands of the chief of the guard, that kept the entrance of the king's house.
<DT><A NAME="12:11">12:11</A><DD>And when the king entered into the house of the LORD, the guard came and fetched them, and brought them again into the guard chamber.
<DT><A NAME="12:12">12:12</A><DD>And when he humbled himself, the wrath of the LORD turned from him, that he would not destroy <I>him</I> altogether: and also in Judah things went well.
<DT><A NAME="12:13">12:13</A><DD>So king Rehoboam strengthened himself in Jerusalem, and reigned: for Rehoboam <I>was</I> one and forty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which the LORD had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, to put his name there. And his mother's name <I>was</I> Naamah an Ammonitess.
<DT><A NAME="12:14">12:14</A><DD>And he did evil, because he prepared not his heart to seek the LORD.
<DT><A NAME="12:15">12:15</A><DD>Now the acts of Rehoboam, first and last, <I>are</I> they not written in the book of Shemaiah the prophet, and of Iddo the seer concerning genealogies? And <I>there were</I> wars between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually.
<DT><A NAME="12:16">12:16</A><DD>And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David: and Abijah his son reigned in his stead.

<DT><A NAME="13:1">13:1</A><DD>Now in the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam began Abijah to reign over Judah.
<DT><A NAME="13:2">13:2</A><DD>He reigned three years in Jerusalem. His mother's name also <I>was</I> Michaiah the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah. And there was war between Abijah and Jeroboam.
<DT><A NAME="13:3">13:3</A><DD>And Abijah set the battle in array with an army of valiant men of war, <I>even</I> four hundred thousand chosen men: Jeroboam also set the battle in array against him with eight hundred thousand chosen men, <I>being</I> mighty men of valour.
<DT><A NAME="13:4">13:4</A><DD>And Abijah stood up upon mount Zemaraim, which <I>is</I> in mount Ephraim, and said, Hear me, thou Jeroboam, and all Israel;
<DT><A NAME="13:5">13:5</A><DD>Ought ye not to know that the LORD God of Israel gave the kingdom over Israel to David for ever, <I>even</I> to him and to his sons by a covenant of salt?
<DT><A NAME="13:6">13:6</A><DD>Yet Jeroboam the son of Nebat, the servant of Solomon the son of David, is risen up, and hath rebelled against his lord.
<DT><A NAME="13:7">13:7</A><DD>And there are gathered unto him vain men, the children of Belial, and have strengthened themselves against Rehoboam the son of Solomon, when Rehoboam was young and tenderhearted, and could not withstand them.
<DT><A NAME="13:8">13:8</A><DD>And now ye think to withstand the kingdom of the LORD in the hand of the sons of David; and ye <I>be</I> a great multitude, and <I>there are</I> with you golden calves, which Jeroboam made you for gods.
<DT><A NAME="13:9">13:9</A><DD>Have ye not cast out the priests of the LORD, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites, and have made you priests after the manner of the nations of <I>other</I> lands? so that whosoever cometh to consecrate himself with a young bullock and seven rams, <I>the same</I> may be a priest of <I>them that are</I> no gods.
<DT><A NAME="13:10">13:10</A><DD>But as for us, the LORD <I>is</I> our God, and we have not forsaken him; and the priests, which minister unto the LORD, <I>are</I> the sons of Aaron, and the Levites <I>wait</I> upon <I>their</I> business:
<DT><A NAME="13:11">13:11</A><DD>And they burn unto the LORD every morning and every evening burnt sacrifices and sweet incense: the shewbread also <I>set they in order</I> upon the pure table; and the candlestick of gold with the lamps thereof, to burn every evening: for we keep the charge of the LORD our God; but ye have forsaken him.
<DT><A NAME="13:12">13:12</A><DD>And, behold, God himself <I>is</I> with us for <I>our</I> captain, and his priests with sounding trumpets to cry alarm against you. O children of Israel, fight ye not against the LORD God of your fathers; for ye shall not prosper.
<DT><A NAME="13:13">13:13</A><DD>But Jeroboam caused an ambushment to come about behind them: so they were before Judah, and the ambushment <I>was</I> behind them.
<DT><A NAME="13:14">13:14</A><DD>And when Judah looked back, behold, the battle <I>was</I> before and behind: and they cried unto the LORD, and the priests sounded with the trumpets.
<DT><A NAME="13:15">13:15</A><DD>Then the men of Judah gave a shout: and as the men of Judah shouted, it came to pass, that God smote Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah.
<DT><A NAME="13:16">13:16</A><DD>And the children of Israel fled before Judah: and God delivered them into their hand.
<DT><A NAME="13:17">13:17</A><DD>And Abijah and his people slew them with a great slaughter: so there fell down slain of Israel five hundred thousand chosen men.
<DT><A NAME="13:18">13:18</A><DD>Thus the children of Israel were brought under at that time, and the children of Judah prevailed, because they relied upon the LORD God of their fathers.
<DT><A NAME="13:19">13:19</A><DD>And Abijah pursued after Jeroboam, and took cities from him, Bethel with the towns thereof, and Jeshanah with the towns thereof, and Ephrain with the towns thereof.
<DT><A NAME="13:20">13:20</A><DD>Neither did Jeroboam recover strength again in the days of Abijah: and the LORD struck him, and he died.
<DT><A NAME="13:21">13:21</A><DD>But Abijah waxed mighty, and married fourteen wives, and begat twenty and two sons, and sixteen daughters.
<DT><A NAME="13:22">13:22</A><DD>And the rest of the acts of Abijah, and his ways, and his sayings, <I>are</I> written in the story of the prophet Iddo.
</DL></DIV><H2>Chapter 14</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="14:1">14:1</A><DD>So Abijah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David: and Asa his son reigned in his stead. In his days the land was quiet ten years.
<DT><A NAME="14:2">14:2</A><DD>And Asa did <I>that which was</I> good and right in the eyes of the LORD his God:
<DT><A NAME="14:3">14:3</A><DD>For he took away the altars of the strange <I>gods</I>, and the high places, and brake down the images, and cut down the groves:
<DT><A NAME="14:4">14:4</A><DD>And commanded Judah to seek the LORD God of their fathers, and to do the law and the commandment.
<DT><A NAME="14:5">14:5</A><DD>Also he took away out of all the cities of Judah the high places and the images: and the kingdom was quiet before him.
<DT><A NAME="14:6">14:6</A><DD>And he built fenced cities in Judah: for the land had rest, and he had no war in those years; because the LORD had given him rest.
<DT><A NAME="14:7">14:7</A><DD>Therefore he said unto Judah, Let us build these cities, and make about <I>them</I> walls, and towers, gates, and bars, <I>while</I> the land <I>is</I> yet before us; because we have sought the LORD our God, we have sought <I>him</I>, and he hath given us rest on every side. So they built and prospered.
<DT><A NAME="14:8">14:8</A><DD>And Asa had an army <I>of men</I> that bare targets and spears, out of Judah three hundred thousand; and out of Benjamin, that bare shields and drew bows, two hundred and fourscore thousand: all these <I>were</I> mighty men of valour.
<DT><A NAME="14:9">14:9</A><DD>And there came out against them Zerah the Ethiopian with an host of a thousand thousand, and three hundred chariots; and came unto Mareshah.
<DT><A NAME="14:10">14:10</A><DD>Then Asa went out against him, and they set the battle in array in the valley of Zephathah at Mareshah.
<DT><A NAME="14:11">14:11</A><DD>And Asa cried unto the LORD his God, and said, LORD, <I>it is</I> nothing with thee to help, whether with many, or with them that have no power: help us, O LORD our God; for we rest on thee, and in thy name we go against this multitude. O LORD, thou <I>art</I> our God; let not man prevail against thee.
<DT><A NAME="14:12">14:12</A><DD>So the LORD smote the Ethiopians before Asa, and before Judah; and the Ethiopians fled.
<DT><A NAME="14:13">14:13</A><DD>And Asa and the people that <I>were</I> with him pursued them unto Gerar: and the Ethiopians were overthrown, that they could not recover themselves; for they were destroyed before the LORD, and before his host; and they carried away very much spoil.
<DT><A NAME="14:14">14:14</A><DD>And they smote all the cities round about Gerar; for the fear of the LORD came upon them: and they spoiled all the cities; for there was exceeding much spoil in them.
<DT><A NAME="14:15">14:15</A><DD>They smote also the tents of cattle, and carried away sheep and camels in abundance, and returned to Jerusalem.
</DL></DIV><H2>Chapter 15</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="15:1">15:1</A><DD>And the Spirit of God came upon Azariah the son of Oded:
<DT><A NAME="15:2">15:2</A><DD>And he went out to meet Asa, and said unto him, Hear ye me, Asa, and all Judah and Benjamin; The LORD <I>is</I> with you, while ye be with him; and if ye seek him, he will be found of you; but if ye forsake him, he will forsake you.
<DT><A NAME="15:3">15:3</A><DD>Now for a long season Israel <I>hath been</I> without the true God, and without a teaching priest, and without law.
<DT><A NAME="15:4">15:4</A><DD>But when they in their trouble did turn unto the LORD God of Israel, and sought him, he was found of them.
<DT><A NAME="15:5">15:5</A><DD>And in those times <I>there was</I> no peace to him that went out, nor to him that came in, but great vexations <I>were</I> upon all the inhabitants of the countries.
<DT><A NAME="15:6">15:6</A><DD>And nation was destroyed of nation, and city of city: for God did vex them with all adversity.
<DT><A NAME="15:7">15:7</A><DD>Be ye strong therefore, and let not your hands be weak: for your work shall be rewarded.
<DT><A NAME="15:8">15:8</A><DD>And when Asa heard these words, and the prophecy of Oded the prophet, he took courage, and put away the abominable idols out of all the land of Judah and Benjamin, and out of the cities which he had taken from mount Ephraim, and renewed the altar of the LORD, that <I>was</I> before the porch of the LORD.
<DT><A NAME="15:9">15:9</A><DD>And he gathered all Judah and Benjamin, and the strangers with them out of Ephraim and Manasseh, and out of Simeon: for they fell to him out of Israel in abundance, when they saw that the LORD his God <I>was</I> with him.
<DT><A NAME="15:10">15:10</A><DD>So they gathered themselves together at Jerusalem in the third month, in the fifteenth year of the reign of Asa.
<DT><A NAME="15:11">15:11</A><DD>And they offered unto the LORD the same time, of the spoil <I>which</I> they had brought, seven hundred oxen and seven thousand sheep.
<DT><A NAME="15:12">15:12</A><DD>And they entered into a covenant to seek the LORD God of their fathers with all their heart and with all their soul;
<DT><A NAME="15:13">15:13</A><DD>That whosoever would not seek the LORD God of Israel should be put to death, whether small or great, whether man or woman.
<DT><A NAME="15:14">15:14</A><DD>And they sware unto the LORD with a loud voice, and with shouting, and with trumpets, and with cornets.
<DT><A NAME="15:15">15:15</A><DD>And all Judah rejoiced at the oath: for they had sworn with all their heart, and sought him with their whole desire; and he was found of them: and the LORD gave them rest round about.
<DT><A NAME="15:16">15:16</A><DD>And also <I>concerning</I> Maachah the mother of Asa the king, he removed her from <I>being</I> queen, because she had made an idol in a grove: and Asa cut down her idol, and stamped <I>it</I>, and burnt <I>it</I> at the brook Kidron.
<DT><A NAME="15:17">15:17</A><DD>But the high places were not taken away out of Israel: nevertheless the heart of Asa was perfect all his days.
<DT><A NAME="15:18">15:18</A><DD>And he brought into the house of God the things that his father had dedicated, and that he himself had dedicated, silver, and gold, and vessels.
<DT><A NAME="15:19">15:19</A><DD>And there was no <I>more</I> war unto the five and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa.

<DT><A NAME="16:1">16:1</A><DD>In the six and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa Baasha king of Israel came up against Judah, and built Ramah, to the intent that he might let none go out or come in to Asa king of Judah.
<DT><A NAME="16:2">16:2</A><DD>Then Asa brought out silver and gold out of the treasures of the house of the LORD and of the king's house, and sent to Benhadad king of Syria, that dwelt at Damascus, saying,
<DT><A NAME="16:3">16:3</A><DD><I>There is</I> a league between me and thee, as <I>there was</I> between my father and thy father: behold, I have sent thee silver and gold; go, break thy league with Baasha king of Israel, that he may depart from me.
<DT><A NAME="16:4">16:4</A><DD>And Benhadad hearkened unto king Asa, and sent the captains of his armies against the cities of Israel; and they smote Ijon, and Dan, and Abelmaim, and all the store cities of Naphtali.

<DT><A NAME="18:4">18:4</A><DD>And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel, Enquire, I pray thee, at the word of the LORD to day.
<DT><A NAME="18:5">18:5</A><DD>Therefore the king of Israel gathered together of prophets four hundred men, and said unto them, Shall we go to Ramothgilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up; for God will deliver <I>it</I> into the king's hand.
<DT><A NAME="18:6">18:6</A><DD>But Jehoshaphat said, <I>Is there</I> not here a prophet of the LORD besides, that we might enquire of him?
<DT><A NAME="18:7">18:7</A><DD>And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, <I>There is</I> yet one man, by whom we may enquire of the LORD: but I hate him; for he never prophesied good unto me, but always evil: the same <I>is</I> Micaiah the son of Imla. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king say so.
<DT><A NAME="18:8">18:8</A><DD>And the king of Israel called for one <I>of his</I> officers, and said, Fetch quickly Micaiah the son of Imla.
<DT><A NAME="18:9">18:9</A><DD>And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah sat either of them on his throne, clothed in <I>their</I> robes, and they sat in a void place at the entering in of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets prophesied before them.
<DT><A NAME="18:10">18:10</A><DD>And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah had made him horns of iron, and said, Thus saith the LORD, With these thou shalt push Syria until they be consumed.
<DT><A NAME="18:11">18:11</A><DD>And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramothgilead, and prosper: for the LORD shall deliver <I>it</I> into the hand of the king.
<DT><A NAME="18:12">18:12</A><DD>And the messenger that went to call Micaiah spake to him, saying, Behold, the words of the prophets <I>declare</I> good to the king with one assent; let thy word therefore, I pray thee, be like one of theirs, and speak thou good.
<DT><A NAME="18:13">18:13</A><DD>And Micaiah said, <I>As</I> the LORD liveth, even what my God saith, that will I speak.
<DT><A NAME="18:14">18:14</A><DD>And when he was come to the king, the king said unto him, Micaiah, shall we go to Ramothgilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And he said, Go ye up, and prosper, and they shall be delivered into your hand.
<DT><A NAME="18:15">18:15</A><DD>And the king said to him, How many times shall I adjure thee that thou say nothing but the truth to me in the name of the LORD?
<DT><A NAME="18:16">18:16</A><DD>Then he said, I did see all Israel scattered upon the mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd: and the LORD said, These have no master; let them return <I>therefore</I> every man to his house in peace.
<DT><A NAME="18:17">18:17</A><DD>And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell thee <I>that</I> he would not prophesy good unto me, but evil?
<DT><A NAME="18:18">18:18</A><DD>Again he said, Therefore hear the word of the LORD; I saw the LORD sitting upon his throne, and all the host of heaven standing on his right hand and <I>on</I> his left.
<DT><A NAME="18:19">18:19</A><DD>And the LORD said, Who shall entice Ahab king of Israel, that he may go up and fall at Ramothgilead? And one spake saying after this manner, and another saying after that manner.
<DT><A NAME="18:20">18:20</A><DD>Then there came out a spirit, and stood before the LORD, and said, I will entice him. And the LORD said unto him, Wherewith?
<DT><A NAME="18:21">18:21</A><DD>And he said, I will go out, and be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And <I>the LORD</I> said, Thou shalt entice <I>him</I>, and thou shalt also prevail: go out, and do <I>even</I> so.
<DT><A NAME="18:22">18:22</A><DD>Now therefore, behold, the LORD hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of these thy prophets, and the LORD hath spoken evil against thee.
<DT><A NAME="18:23">18:23</A><DD>Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near, and smote Micaiah upon the cheek, and said, Which way went the Spirit of the LORD from me to speak unto thee?
<DT><A NAME="18:24">18:24</A><DD>And Micaiah said, Behold, thou shalt see on that day when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself.
<DT><A NAME="18:25">18:25</A><DD>Then the king of Israel said, Take ye Micaiah, and carry him back to Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king's son;
<DT><A NAME="18:26">18:26</A><DD>And say, Thus saith the king, Put this <I>fellow</I> in the prison, and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction, until I return in peace.
<DT><A NAME="18:27">18:27</A><DD>And Micaiah said, If thou certainly return in peace, <I>then</I> hath not the LORD spoken by me. And he said, Hearken, all ye people.
<DT><A NAME="18:28">18:28</A><DD>So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramothgilead.
<DT><A NAME="18:29">18:29</A><DD>And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself, and will go to the battle; but put thou on thy robes. So the king of Israel disguised himself; and they went to the battle.
<DT><A NAME="18:30">18:30</A><DD>Now the king of Syria had commanded the captains of the chariots that <I>were</I> with him, saying, Fight ye not with small or great, save only with the king of Israel.
<DT><A NAME="18:31">18:31</A><DD>And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, It <I>is</I> the king of Israel. Therefore they compassed about him to fight: but Jehoshaphat cried out, and the LORD helped him; and God moved them <I>to depart</I> from him.
<DT><A NAME="18:32">18:32</A><DD>For it came to pass, that, when the captains of the chariots perceived that it was not the king of Israel, they turned back again from pursuing him.
<DT><A NAME="18:33">18:33</A><DD>And a <I>certain</I> man drew a bow at a venture, and smote the king of Israel between the joints of the harness: therefore he said to his chariot man, Turn thine hand, that thou mayest carry me out of the host; for I am wounded.
<DT><A NAME="18:34">18:34</A><DD>And the battle increased that day: howbeit the king of Israel stayed <I>himself</I> up in <I>his</I> chariot against the Syrians until the even: and about the time of the sun going down he died.

<DT><A NAME="21:13">21:13</A><DD>But hast walked in the way of the kings of Israel, and hast made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to go a whoring, like to the whoredoms of the house of Ahab, and also hast slain thy brethren of thy father's house, <I>which were</I> better than thyself:

<DT><A NAME="22:7">22:7</A><DD>And the destruction of Ahaziah was of God by coming to Joram: for when he was come, he went out with Jehoram against Jehu the son of Nimshi, whom the LORD had anointed to cut off the house of Ahab.

<DT><A NAME="23:8">23:8</A><DD>So the Levites and all Judah did according to all things that Jehoiada the priest had commanded, and took every man his men that were to come in on the sabbath, with them that were to go <I>out</I> on the sabbath: for Jehoiada the priest dismissed not the courses.
<DT><A NAME="23:9">23:9</A><DD>Moreover Jehoiada the priest delivered to the captains of hundreds spears, and bucklers, and shields, that <I>had been</I> king David's, which <I>were</I> in the house of God.

Then Athaliah rent her clothes, and said, Treason, Treason.
<DT><A NAME="23:14">23:14</A><DD>Then Jehoiada the priest brought out the captains of hundreds that were set over the host, and said unto them, Have her forth of the ranges: and whoso followeth her, let him be slain with the sword. For the priest said, Slay her not in the house of the LORD.

<DT><A NAME="23:17">23:17</A><DD>Then all the people went to the house of Baal, and brake it down, and brake his altars and his images in pieces, and slew Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars.
<DT><A NAME="23:18">23:18</A><DD>Also Jehoiada appointed the offices of the house of the LORD by the hand of the priests the Levites, whom David had distributed in the house of the LORD, to offer the burnt offerings of the LORD, as <I>it is</I> written in the law of Moses, with rejoicing and with singing, <I>as it was ordained</I> by David.

<DT><A NAME="23:20">23:20</A><DD>And he took the captains of hundreds, and the nobles, and the governors of the people, and all the people of the land, and brought down the king from the house of the LORD: and they came through the high gate into the king's house, and set the king upon the throne of the kingdom.
<DT><A NAME="23:21">23:21</A><DD>And all the people of the land rejoiced: and the city was quiet, after that they had slain Athaliah with the sword.

<DT><A NAME="24:12">24:12</A><DD>And the king and Jehoiada gave it to such as did the work of the service of the house of the LORD, and hired masons and carpenters to repair the house of the LORD, and also such as wrought iron and brass to mend the house of the LORD.

<DT><A NAME="25:3">25:3</A><DD>Now it came to pass, when the kingdom was established to him, that he slew his servants that had killed the king his father.
<DT><A NAME="25:4">25:4</A><DD>But he slew not their children, but <I>did</I> as <I>it is</I> written in the law in the book of Moses, where the LORD commanded, saying, The fathers shall not die for the children, neither shall the children die for the fathers, but every man shall die for his own sin.
<DT><A NAME="25:5">25:5</A><DD>Moreover Amaziah gathered Judah together, and made them captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, according to the houses of <I>their</I> fathers, throughout all Judah and Benjamin: and he numbered them from twenty years old and above, and found them three hundred thousand choice <I>men, able</I> to go forth to war, that could handle spear and shield.
<DT><A NAME="25:6">25:6</A><DD>He hired also an hundred thousand mighty men of valour out of Israel for an hundred talents of silver.
<DT><A NAME="25:7">25:7</A><DD>But there came a man of God to him, saying, O king, let not the army of Israel go with thee; for the LORD <I>is</I> not with Israel, <I>to wit, with</I> all the children of Ephraim.
<DT><A NAME="25:8">25:8</A><DD>But if thou wilt go, do <I>it</I>, be strong for the battle: God shall make thee fall before the enemy: for God hath power to help, and to cast down.
<DT><A NAME="25:9">25:9</A><DD>And Amaziah said to the man of God, But what shall we do for the hundred talents which I have given to the army of Israel? And the man of God answered, The LORD is able to give thee much more than this.
<DT><A NAME="25:10">25:10</A><DD>Then Amaziah separated them, <I>to wit</I>, the army that was come to him out of Ephraim, to go home again: wherefore their anger was greatly kindled against Judah, and they returned home in great anger.
<DT><A NAME="25:11">25:11</A><DD>And Amaziah strengthened himself, and led forth his people, and went to the valley of salt, and smote of the children of Seir ten thousand.

<DT><A NAME="25:14">25:14</A><DD>Now it came to pass, after that Amaziah was come from the slaughter of the Edomites, that he brought the gods of the children of Seir, and set them up <I>to be</I> his gods, and bowed down himself before them, and burned incense unto them.
<DT><A NAME="25:15">25:15</A><DD>Wherefore the anger of the LORD was kindled against Amaziah, and he sent unto him a prophet, which said unto him, Why hast thou sought after the gods of the people, which could not deliver their own people out of thine hand?
<DT><A NAME="25:16">25:16</A><DD>And it came to pass, as he talked with him, that <I>the king</I> said unto him, Art thou made of the king's counsel? forbear; why shouldest thou be smitten? Then the prophet forbare, and said, I know that God hath determined to destroy thee, because thou hast done this, and hast not hearkened unto my counsel.
<DT><A NAME="25:17">25:17</A><DD>Then Amaziah king of Judah took advice, and sent to Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, Come, let us see one another in the face.
<DT><A NAME="25:18">25:18</A><DD>And Joash king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, The thistle that <I>was</I> in Lebanon sent to the cedar that <I>was</I> in Lebanon, saying, Give thy daughter to my son to wife: and there passed by a wild beast that <I>was</I> in Lebanon, and trode down the thistle.

<DT><A NAME="25:21">25:21</A><DD>So Joash the king of Israel went up; and they saw one another in the face, <I>both</I> he and Amaziah king of Judah, at Bethshemesh, which <I>belongeth</I> to Judah.

<DT><A NAME="28:12">28:12</A><DD>Then certain of the heads of the children of Ephraim, Azariah the son of Johanan, Berechiah the son of Meshillemoth, and Jehizkiah the son of Shallum, and Amasa the son of Hadlai, stood up against them that came from the war,
<DT><A NAME="28:13">28:13</A><DD>And said unto them, Ye shall not bring in the captives hither: for whereas we have offended against the LORD <I>already</I>, ye intend to add <I>more</I> to our sins and to our trespass: for our trespass is great, and <I>there is</I> fierce wrath against Israel.
<DT><A NAME="28:14">28:14</A><DD>So the armed men left the captives and the spoil before the princes and all the congregation.

<DT><A NAME="28:16">28:16</A><DD>At that time did king Ahaz send unto the kings of Assyria to help him.
<DT><A NAME="28:17">28:17</A><DD>For again the Edomites had come and smitten Judah, and carried away captives.
<DT><A NAME="28:18">28:18</A><DD>The Philistines also had invaded the cities of the low country, and of the south of Judah, and had taken Bethshemesh, and Ajalon, and Gederoth, and Shocho with the villages thereof, and Timnah with the villages thereof, Gimzo also and the villages thereof: and they dwelt there.
<DT><A NAME="28:19">28:19</A><DD>For the LORD brought Judah low because of Ahaz king of Israel; for he made Judah naked, and transgressed sore against the LORD.
<DT><A NAME="28:20">28:20</A><DD>And Tilgathpilneser king of Assyria came unto him, and distressed him, but strengthened him not.
<DT><A NAME="28:21">28:21</A><DD>For Ahaz took away a portion <I>out</I> of the house of the LORD, and <I>out</I> of the house of the king, and of the princes, and gave <I>it</I> unto the king of Assyria: but he helped him not.
<DT><A NAME="28:22">28:22</A><DD>And in the time of his distress did he trespass yet more against the LORD: this <I>is that</I> king Ahaz.
<DT><A NAME="28:23">28:23</A><DD>For he sacrificed unto the gods of Damascus, which smote him: and he said, Because the gods of the kings of Syria help them, <I>therefore</I> will I sacrifice to them, that they may help me. But they were the ruin of him, and of all Israel.
<DT><A NAME="28:24">28:24</A><DD>And Ahaz gathered together the vessels of the house of God, and cut in pieces the vessels of the house of God, and shut up the doors of the house of the LORD, and he made him altars in every corner of Jerusalem.
<DT><A NAME="28:25">28:25</A><DD>And in every several city of Judah he made high places to burn incense unto other gods, and provoked to anger the LORD God of his fathers.
<DT><A NAME="28:26">28:26</A><DD>Now the rest of his acts and of all his ways, first and last, behold, they <I>are</I> written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.
<DT><A NAME="28:27">28:27</A><DD>And Ahaz slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city, <I>even</I> in Jerusalem: but they brought him not into the sepulchres of the kings of Israel: and Hezekiah his son reigned in his stead.

<DT><A NAME="29:17">29:17</A><DD>Now they began on the first <I>day</I> of the first month to sanctify, and on the eighth day of the month came they to the porch of the LORD: so they sanctified the house of the LORD in eight days; and in the sixteenth day of the first month they made an end.
<DT><A NAME="29:18">29:18</A><DD>Then they went in to Hezekiah the king, and said, We have cleansed all the house of the LORD, and the altar of burnt offering, with all the vessels thereof, and the shewbread table, with all the vessels thereof.

<DT><A NAME="29:24">29:24</A><DD>And the priests killed them, and they made reconciliation with their blood upon the altar, to make an atonement for all Israel: for the king commanded <I>that</I> the burnt offering and the sin offering <I>should be made</I> for all Israel.
<DT><A NAME="29:25">29:25</A><DD>And he set the Levites in the house of the LORD with cymbals, with psalteries, and with harps, according to the commandment of David, and of Gad the king's seer, and Nathan the prophet: for <I>so was</I> the commandment of the LORD by his prophets.
<DT><A NAME="29:26">29:26</A><DD>And the Levites stood with the instruments of David, and the priests with the trumpets.
<DT><A NAME="29:27">29:27</A><DD>And Hezekiah commanded to offer the burnt offering upon the altar. And when the burnt offering began, the song of the LORD began <I>also</I> with the trumpets, and with the instruments <I>ordained</I> by David king of Israel.
<DT><A NAME="29:28">29:28</A><DD>And all the congregation worshipped, and the singers sang, and the trumpeters sounded: <I>and</I> all <I>this continued</I> until the burnt offering was finished.
<DT><A NAME="29:29">29:29</A><DD>And when they had made an end of offering, the king and all that were present with him bowed themselves, and worshipped.
<DT><A NAME="29:30">29:30</A><DD>Moreover Hezekiah the king and the princes commanded the Levites to sing praise unto the LORD with the words of David, and of Asaph the seer. And they sang praises with gladness, and they bowed their heads and worshipped.
<DT><A NAME="29:31">29:31</A><DD>Then Hezekiah answered and said, Now ye have consecrated yourselves unto the LORD, come near and bring sacrifices and thank offerings into the house of the LORD. And the congregation brought in sacrifices and thank offerings; and as many as were of a free heart burnt offerings.
<DT><A NAME="29:32">29:32</A><DD>And the number of the burnt offerings, which the congregation brought, was threescore and ten bullocks, an hundred rams, <I>and</I> two hundred lambs: all these <I>were</I> for a burnt offering to the LORD.
<DT><A NAME="29:33">29:33</A><DD>And the consecrated things <I>were</I> six hundred oxen and three thousand sheep.
<DT><A NAME="29:34">29:34</A><DD>But the priests were too few, so that they could not flay all the burnt offerings: wherefore their brethren the Levites did help them, till the work was ended, and until the <I>other</I> priests had sanctified themselves: for the Levites <I>were</I> more upright in heart to sanctify themselves than the priests.
<DT><A NAME="29:35">29:35</A><DD>And also the burnt offerings <I>were</I> in abundance, with the fat of the peace offerings, and the drink offerings for <I>every</I> burnt offering. So the service of the house of the LORD was set in order.
<DT><A NAME="29:36">29:36</A><DD>And Hezekiah rejoiced, and all the people, that God had prepared the people: for the thing was <I>done</I> suddenly.

<DT><A NAME="30:1">30:1</A><DD>And Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Judah, and wrote letters also to Ephraim and Manasseh, that they should come to the house of the LORD at Jerusalem, to keep the passover unto the LORD God of Israel.
<DT><A NAME="30:2">30:2</A><DD>For the king had taken counsel, and his princes, and all the congregation in Jerusalem, to keep the passover in the second month.
<DT><A NAME="30:3">30:3</A><DD>For they could not keep it at that time, because the priests had not sanctified themselves sufficiently, neither had the people gathered themselves together to Jerusalem.
<DT><A NAME="30:4">30:4</A><DD>And the thing pleased the king and all the congregation.
<DT><A NAME="30:5">30:5</A><DD>So they established a decree to make proclamation throughout all Israel, from Beersheba even to Dan, that they should come to keep the passover unto the LORD God of Israel at Jerusalem: for they had not done <I>it</I> of a long <I>time in such sort</I> as it was written.
<DT><A NAME="30:6">30:6</A><DD>So the posts went with the letters from the king and his princes throughout all Israel and Judah, and according to the commandment of the king, saying, Ye children of Israel, turn again unto the LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, and he will return to the remnant of you, that are escaped out of the hand of the kings of Assyria.
<DT><A NAME="30:7">30:7</A><DD>And be not ye like your fathers, and like your brethren, which trespassed against the LORD God of their fathers, <I>who</I> therefore gave them up to desolation, as ye see.
<DT><A NAME="30:8">30:8</A><DD>Now be ye not stiffnecked, as your fathers <I>were, but</I> yield yourselves unto the LORD, and enter into his sanctuary, which he hath sanctified for ever: and serve the LORD your God, that the fierceness of his wrath may turn away from you.
<DT><A NAME="30:9">30:9</A><DD>For if ye turn again unto the LORD, your brethren and your children <I>shall find</I> compassion before them that lead them captive, so that they shall come again into this land: for the LORD your God <I>is</I> gracious and merciful, and will not turn away <I>his</I> face from you, if ye return unto him.
<DT><A NAME="30:10">30:10</A><DD>So the posts passed from city to city through the country of Ephraim and Manasseh even unto Zebulun: but they laughed them to scorn, and mocked them.
<DT><A NAME="30:11">30:11</A><DD>Nevertheless divers of Asher and Manasseh and of Zebulun humbled themselves, and came to Jerusalem.
<DT><A NAME="30:12">30:12</A><DD>Also in Judah the hand of God was to give them one heart to do the commandment of the king and of the princes, by the word of the LORD.
<DT><A NAME="30:13">30:13</A><DD>And there assembled at Jerusalem much people to keep the feast of unleavened bread in the second month, a very great congregation.
<DT><A NAME="30:14">30:14</A><DD>And they arose and took away the altars that <I>were</I> in Jerusalem, and all the altars for incense took they away, and cast <I>them</I> into the brook Kidron.
<DT><A NAME="30:15">30:15</A><DD>Then they killed the passover on the fourteenth <I>day</I> of the second month: and the priests and the Levites were ashamed, and sanctified themselves, and brought in the burnt offerings into the house of the LORD.
<DT><A NAME="30:16">30:16</A><DD>And they stood in their place after their manner, according to the law of Moses the man of God: the priests sprinkled the blood, <I>which they received</I> of the hand of the Levites.
<DT><A NAME="30:17">30:17</A><DD>For <I>there were</I> many in the congregation that were not sanctified: therefore the Levites had the charge of the killing of the passovers for every one <I>that was</I> not clean, to sanctify <I>them</I> unto the LORD.
<DT><A NAME="30:18">30:18</A><DD>For a multitude of the people, <I>even</I> many of Ephraim, and Manasseh, Issachar, and Zebulun, had not cleansed themselves, yet did they eat the passover otherwise than it was written. But Hezekiah prayed for them, saying, The good LORD pardon every one
<DT><A NAME="30:19">30:19</A><DD><I>That</I> prepareth his heart to seek God, the LORD God of his fathers, though <I>he be</I> not <I>cleansed</I> according to the purification of the sanctuary.
<DT><A NAME="30:20">30:20</A><DD>And the LORD hearkened to Hezekiah, and healed the people.
<DT><A NAME="30:21">30:21</A><DD>And the children of Israel that were present at Jerusalem kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with great gladness: and the Levites and the priests praised the LORD day by day, <I>singing</I> with loud instruments unto the LORD.
<DT><A NAME="30:22">30:22</A><DD>And Hezekiah spake comfortably unto all the Levites that taught the good knowledge of the LORD: and they did eat throughout the feast seven days, offering peace offerings, and making confession to the LORD God of their fathers.
<DT><A NAME="30:23">30:23</A><DD>And the whole assembly took counsel to keep other seven days: and they kept <I>other</I> seven days with gladness.
<DT><A NAME="30:24">30:24</A><DD>For Hezekiah king of Judah did give to the congregation a thousand bullocks and seven thousand sheep; and the princes gave to the congregation a thousand bullocks and ten thousand sheep: and a great number of priests sanctified themselves.
<DT><A NAME="30:25">30:25</A><DD>And all the congregation of Judah, with the priests and the Levites, and all the congregation that came out of Israel, and the strangers that came out of the land of Israel, and that dwelt in Judah, rejoiced.
<DT><A NAME="30:26">30:26</A><DD>So there was great joy in Jerusalem: for since the time of Solomon the son of David king of Israel <I>there was</I> not the like in Jerusalem.
<DT><A NAME="30:27">30:27</A><DD>Then the priests the Levites arose and blessed the people: and their voice was heard, and their prayer came <I>up</I> to his holy dwelling place, <I>even</I> unto heaven.

<DT><A NAME="31:11">31:11</A><DD>Then Hezekiah commanded to prepare chambers in the house of the LORD; and they prepared <I>them</I>,

<DT><A NAME="32:17">32:17</A><DD>He wrote also letters to rail on the LORD God of Israel, and to speak against him, saying, As the gods of the nations of <I>other</I> lands have not delivered their people out of mine hand, so shall not the God of Hezekiah deliver his people out of mine hand.
<DT><A NAME="32:18">32:18</A><DD>Then they cried with a loud voice in the Jews' speech unto the people of Jerusalem that <I>were</I> on the wall, to affright them, and to trouble them; that they might take the city.
<DT><A NAME="32:19">32:19</A><DD>And they spake against the God of Jerusalem, as against the gods of the people of the earth, <I>which were</I> the work of the hands of man.
<DT><A NAME="32:20">32:20</A><DD>And for this <I>cause</I> Hezekiah the king, and the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz, prayed and cried to heaven.
<DT><A NAME="32:21">32:21</A><DD>And the LORD sent an angel, which cut off all the mighty men of valour, and the leaders and captains in the camp of the king of Assyria. So he returned with shame of face to his own land. And when he was come into the house of his god, they that came forth of his own bowels slew him there with the sword.
<DT><A NAME="32:22">32:22</A><DD>Thus the LORD saved Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem from the hand of Sennacherib the king of Assyria, and from the hand of all <I>other</I>, and guided them on every side.
<DT><A NAME="32:23">32:23</A><DD>And many brought gifts unto the LORD to Jerusalem, and presents to Hezekiah king of Judah: so that he was magnified in the sight of all nations from thenceforth.
<DT><A NAME="32:24">32:24</A><DD>In those days Hezekiah was sick to the death, and prayed unto the LORD: and he spake unto him, and he gave him a sign.
<DT><A NAME="32:25">32:25</A><DD>But Hezekiah rendered not again according to the benefit <I>done</I> unto him; for his heart was lifted up: therefore there was wrath upon him, and upon Judah and Jerusalem.
<DT><A NAME="32:26">32:26</A><DD>Notwithstanding Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his heart, <I>both</I> he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the wrath of the LORD came not upon them in the days of Hezekiah.
<DT><A NAME="32:27">32:27</A><DD>And Hezekiah had exceeding much riches and honour: and he made himself treasuries for silver, and for gold, and for precious stones, and for spices, and for shields, and for all manner of pleasant jewels;
<DT><A NAME="32:28">32:28</A><DD>Storehouses also for the increase of corn, and wine, and oil; and stalls for all manner of beasts, and cotes for flocks.
<DT><A NAME="32:29">32:29</A><DD>Moreover he provided him cities, and possessions of flocks and herds in abundance: for God had given him substance very much.
<DT><A NAME="32:30">32:30</A><DD>This same Hezekiah also stopped the upper watercourse of Gihon, and brought it straight down to the west side of the city of David. And Hezekiah prospered in all his works.
<DT><A NAME="32:31">32:31</A><DD>Howbeit in <I>the business of</I> the ambassadors of the princes of Babylon, who sent unto him to enquire of the wonder that was <I>done</I> in the land, God left him, to try him, that he might know all <I>that was</I> in his heart.
<DT><A NAME="32:32">32:32</A><DD>Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and his goodness, behold, they <I>are</I> written in the vision of Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, <I>and</I> in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.
<DT><A NAME="32:33">32:33</A><DD>And Hezekiah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the chiefest of the sepulchres of the sons of David: and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem did him honour at his death. And Manasseh his son reigned in his stead.

<DT><A NAME="33:1">33:1</A><DD>Manasseh <I>was</I> twelve years old when he began to reign, and he reigned fifty and five years in Jerusalem:
<DT><A NAME="33:2">33:2</A><DD>But did <I>that which was</I> evil in the sight of the LORD, like unto the abominations of the heathen, whom the LORD had cast out before the children of Israel.
<DT><A NAME="33:3">33:3</A><DD>For he built again the high places which Hezekiah his father had broken down, and he reared up altars for Baalim, and made groves, and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served them.
<DT><A NAME="33:4">33:4</A><DD>Also he built altars in the house of the LORD, whereof the LORD had said, In Jerusalem shall my name be for ever.
<DT><A NAME="33:5">33:5</A><DD>And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the LORD.
<DT><A NAME="33:6">33:6</A><DD>And he caused his children to pass through the fire in the valley of the son of Hinnom: also he observed times, and used enchantments, and used witchcraft, and dealt with a familiar spirit, and with wizards: he wrought much evil in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger.
<DT><A NAME="33:7">33:7</A><DD>And he set a carved image, the idol which he had made, in the house of God, of which God had said to David and to Solomon his son, In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen before all the tribes of Israel, will I put my name for ever:
<DT><A NAME="33:8">33:8</A><DD>Neither will I any more remove the foot of Israel from out of the land which I have appointed for your fathers; so that they will take heed to do all that I have commanded them, according to the whole law and the statutes and the ordinances by the hand of Moses.
<DT><A NAME="33:9">33:9</A><DD>So Manasseh made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to err, <I>and</I> to do worse than the heathen, whom the LORD had destroyed before the children of Israel.
<DT><A NAME="33:10">33:10</A><DD>And the LORD spake to Manasseh, and to his people: but they would not hearken.
<DT><A NAME="33:11">33:11</A><DD>Wherefore the LORD brought upon them the captains of the host of the king of Assyria, which took Manasseh among the thorns, and bound him with fetters, and carried him to Babylon.
<DT><A NAME="33:12">33:12</A><DD>And when he was in affliction, he besought the LORD his God, and humbled himself greatly before the God of his fathers,
<DT><A NAME="33:13">33:13</A><DD>And prayed unto him: and he was intreated of him, and heard his supplication, and brought him again to Jerusalem into his kingdom. Then Manasseh knew that the LORD he <I>was</I> God.
<DT><A NAME="33:14">33:14</A><DD>Now after this he built a wall without the city of David, on the west side of Gihon, in the valley, even to the entering in at the fish gate, and compassed about Ophel, and raised it up a very great height, and put captains of war in all the fenced cities of Judah.
<DT><A NAME="33:15">33:15</A><DD>And he took away the strange gods, and the idol out of the house of the LORD, and all the altars that he had built in the mount of the house of the LORD, and in Jerusalem, and cast <I>them</I> out of the city.
<DT><A NAME="33:16">33:16</A><DD>And he repaired the altar of the LORD, and sacrificed thereon peace offerings and thank offerings, and commanded Judah to serve the LORD God of Israel.
<DT><A NAME="33:17">33:17</A><DD>Nevertheless the people did sacrifice still in the high places, <I>yet</I> unto the LORD their God only.
<DT><A NAME="33:18">33:18</A><DD>Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and his prayer unto his God, and the words of the seers that spake to him in the name of the LORD God of Israel, behold, they <I>are written</I> in the book of the kings of Israel.
<DT><A NAME="33:19">33:19</A><DD>His prayer also, and <I>how God</I> was intreated of him, and all his sin, and his trespass, and the places wherein he built high places, and set up groves and graven images, before he was humbled: behold, they <I>are</I> written among the sayings of the seers.
<DT><A NAME="33:20">33:20</A><DD>So Manasseh slept with his fathers, and they buried him in his own house: and Amon his son reigned in his stead.
<DT><A NAME="33:21">33:21</A><DD>Amon <I>was</I> two and twenty years old when he began to reign, and reigned two years in Jerusalem.
<DT><A NAME="33:22">33:22</A><DD>But he did <I>that which was</I> evil in the sight of the LORD, as did Manasseh his father: for Amon sacrificed unto all the carved images which Manasseh his father had made, and served them;
<DT><A NAME="33:23">33:23</A><DD>And humbled not himself before the LORD, as Manasseh his father had humbled himself; but Amon trespassed more and more.
<DT><A NAME="33:24">33:24</A><DD>And his servants conspired against him, and slew him in his own house.
<DT><A NAME="33:25">33:25</A><DD>But the people of the land slew all them that had conspired against king Amon; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his stead.

<DT><A NAME="34:3">34:3</A><DD>For in the eighth year of his reign, while he was yet young, he began to seek after the God of David his father: and in the twelfth year he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem from the high places, and the groves, and the carved images, and the molten images.
<DT><A NAME="34:4">34:4</A><DD>And they brake down the altars of Baalim in his presence; and the images, that <I>were</I> on high above them, he cut down; and the groves, and the carved images, and the molten images, he brake in pieces, and made dust <I>of them</I>, and strowed <I>it</I> upon the graves of them that had sacrificed unto them.

<DT><A NAME="34:7">34:7</A><DD>And when he had broken down the altars and the groves, and had beaten the graven images into powder, and cut down all the idols throughout all the land of Israel, he returned to Jerusalem.
<DT><A NAME="34:8">34:8</A><DD>Now in the eighteenth year of his reign, when he had purged the land, and the house, he sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, and Maaseiah the governor of the city, and Joah the son of Joahaz the recorder, to repair the house of the LORD his God.
<DT><A NAME="34:9">34:9</A><DD>And when they came to Hilkiah the high priest, they delivered the money that was brought into the house of God, which the Levites that kept the doors had gathered of the hand of Manasseh and Ephraim, and of all the remnant of Israel, and of all Judah and Benjamin; and they returned to Jerusalem.
<DT><A NAME="34:10">34:10</A><DD>And they put <I>it</I> in the hand of the workmen that had the oversight of the house of the LORD, and they gave it to the workmen that wrought in the house of the LORD, to repair and amend the house:
<DT><A NAME="34:11">34:11</A><DD>Even to the artificers and builders gave they <I>it</I>, to buy hewn stone, and timber for couplings, and to floor the houses which the kings of Judah had destroyed.
<DT><A NAME="34:12">34:12</A><DD>And the men did the work faithfully: and the overseers of them <I>were</I> Jahath and Obadiah, the Levites, of the sons of Merari; and Zechariah and Meshullam, of the sons of the Kohathites, to set <I>it</I> forward; and <I>other of</I> the Levites, all that could skill of instruments of musick.

<DT><A NAME="35:6">35:6</A><DD>So kill the passover, and sanctify yourselves, and prepare your brethren, that <I>they</I> may do according to the word of the LORD by the hand of Moses.
<DT><A NAME="35:7">35:7</A><DD>And Josiah gave to the people, of the flock, lambs and kids, all for the passover offerings, for all that were present, to the number of thirty thousand, and three thousand bullocks: these <I>were</I> of the king's substance.
<DT><A NAME="35:8">35:8</A><DD>And his princes gave willingly unto the people, to the priests, and to the Levites: Hilkiah and Zechariah and Jehiel, rulers of the house of God, gave unto the priests for the passover offerings two thousand and six hundred <I>small cattle</I>, and three hundred oxen.

<DT><A NAME="35:11">35:11</A><DD>And they killed the passover, and the priests sprinkled <I>the blood</I> from their hands, and the Levites flayed <I>them</I>.
<DT><A NAME="35:12">35:12</A><DD>And they removed the burnt offerings, that they might give according to the divisions of the families of the people, to offer unto the LORD, as <I>it is</I> written in the book of Moses. And so <I>did they</I> with the oxen.
<DT><A NAME="35:13">35:13</A><DD>And they roasted the passover with fire according to the ordinance: but the <I>other</I> holy <I>offerings</I> sod they in pots, and in caldrons, and in pans, and divided <I>them</I> speedily among all the people.
<DT><A NAME="35:14">35:14</A><DD>And afterward they made ready for themselves, and for the priests: because the priests the sons of Aaron <I>were busied</I> in offering of burnt offerings and the fat until night; therefore the Levites prepared for themselves, and for the priests the sons of Aaron.
<DT><A NAME="35:15">35:15</A><DD>And the singers the sons of Asaph <I>were</I> in their place, according to the commandment of David, and Asaph, and Heman, and Jeduthun the king's seer; and the porters <I>waited</I> at every gate; they might not depart from their service; for their brethren the Levites prepared for them.
<DT><A NAME="35:16">35:16</A><DD>So all the service of the LORD was prepared the same day, to keep the passover, and to offer burnt offerings upon the altar of the LORD, according to the commandment of king Josiah.

<DT><A NAME="36:15">36:15</A><DD>And the LORD God of their fathers sent to them by his messengers, rising up betimes, and sending; because he had compassion on his people, and on his dwelling place:
<DT><A NAME="36:16">36:16</A><DD>But they mocked the messengers of God, and despised his words, and misused his prophets, until the wrath of the LORD arose against his people, till <I>there was</I> no remedy.
<DT><A NAME="36:17">36:17</A><DD>Therefore he brought upon them the king of the Chaldees, who slew their young men with the sword in the house of their sanctuary, and had no compassion upon young man or maiden, old man, or him that stooped for age: he gave <I>them</I> all into his hand.
<DT><A NAME="36:18">36:18</A><DD>And all the vessels of the house of God, great and small, and the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king, and of his princes; all <I>these</I> he brought to Babylon.

<DT><A NAME="36:23">36:23</A><DD>Thus saith Cyrus king of Persia, All the kingdoms of the earth hath the LORD God of heaven given me; and he hath charged me to build him an house in Jerusalem, which <I>is</I> in Judah.
