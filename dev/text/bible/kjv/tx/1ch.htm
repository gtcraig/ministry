<DT><A NAME="17:18">17:18</A><DD>What can David <I>speak</I> more to thee for the honour of thy servant? for thou knowest thy servant.
<DT><A NAME="17:19">17:19</A><DD>O LORD, for thy servant's sake, and according to thine own heart, hast thou done all this greatness, in making known all <I>these</I> great things.

<DT><A NAME="17:25">17:25</A><DD>For thou, O my God, hast told thy servant that thou wilt build him an house: therefore thy servant hath found <I>in his heart</I> to pray before thee.

<DT><A NAME="19:3">19:3</A><DD>But the princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanun, Thinkest thou that David doth honour thy father, that he hath sent comforters unto thee? are not his servants come unto thee for to search, and to overthrow, and to spy out the land?
<DT><A NAME="19:4">19:4</A><DD>Wherefore Hanun took David's servants, and shaved them, and cut off their garments in the midst hard by their buttocks, and sent them away.
<DT><A NAME="19:5">19:5</A><DD>Then there went <I>certain</I>, and told David how the men were served. And he sent to meet them: for the men were greatly ashamed. And the king said, Tarry at Jericho until your beards be grown, and <I>then</I> return.
<DT><A NAME="19:6">19:6</A><DD>And when the children of Ammon saw that they had made themselves odious to David, Hanun and the children of Ammon sent a thousand talents of silver to hire them chariots and horsemen out of Mesopotamia, and out of Syriamaachah, and out of Zobah.
<DT><A NAME="19:7">19:7</A><DD>So they hired thirty and two thousand chariots, and the king of Maachah and his people; who came and pitched before Medeba. And the children of Ammon gathered themselves together from their cities, and came to battle.

<DT><A NAME="21:8">21:8</A><DD>And David said unto God, I have sinned greatly, because I have done this thing: but now, I beseech thee, do away the iniquity of thy servant; for I have done very foolishly.
