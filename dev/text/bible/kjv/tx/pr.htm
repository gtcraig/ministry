<DT><A NAME="1:1">1:1</A><DD>The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel;
<DT><A NAME="1:2">1:2</A><DD>To know wisdom and instruction; to perceive the words of understanding;
<DT><A NAME="1:3">1:3</A><DD>To receive the instruction of wisdom, justice, and judgment, and equity;
<DT><A NAME="1:4">1:4</A><DD>To give subtilty to the simple, to the young man knowledge and discretion.
<DT><A NAME="1:5">1:5</A><DD>A wise <I>man</I> will hear, and will increase learning; and a man of understanding shall attain unto wise counsels:
<DT><A NAME="1:6">1:6</A><DD>To understand a proverb, and the interpretation; the words of the wise, and their dark sayings.
<DT><A NAME="1:7">1:7</A><DD>The fear of the LORD <I>is</I> the beginning of knowledge: <I>but</I> fools despise wisdom and instruction.
<DT><A NAME="1:8">1:8</A><DD>My son, hear the instruction of thy father, and forsake not the law of thy mother:
<DT><A NAME="1:9">1:9</A><DD>For they <I>shall be</I> an ornament of grace unto thy head, and chains about thy neck.
<DT><A NAME="1:10">1:10</A><DD>My son, if sinners entice thee, consent thou not.
<DT><A NAME="1:11">1:11</A><DD>If they say, Come with us, let us lay wait for blood, let us lurk privily for the innocent without cause:
<DT><A NAME="1:12">1:12</A><DD>Let us swallow them up alive as the grave; and whole, as those that go down into the pit:
<DT><A NAME="1:13">1:13</A><DD>We shall find all precious substance, we shall fill our houses with spoil:
<DT><A NAME="1:14">1:14</A><DD>Cast in thy lot among us; let us all have one purse:
<DT><A NAME="1:15">1:15</A><DD>My son, walk not thou in the way with them; refrain thy foot from their path:
<DT><A NAME="1:16">1:16</A><DD>For their feet run to evil, and make haste to shed blood.
<DT><A NAME="1:17">1:17</A><DD>Surely in vain the net is spread in the sight of any bird.
<DT><A NAME="1:18">1:18</A><DD>And they lay wait for their <I>own</I> blood; they lurk privily for their <I>own</I> lives.
<DT><A NAME="1:19">1:19</A><DD>So <I>are</I> the ways of every one that is greedy of gain; <I>which</I> taketh away the life of the owners thereof.
<DT><A NAME="1:20">1:20</A><DD>Wisdom crieth without; she uttereth her voice in the streets:
<DT><A NAME="1:21">1:21</A><DD>She crieth in the chief place of concourse, in the openings of the gates: in the city she uttereth her words, <I>saying</I>,
<DT><A NAME="1:22">1:22</A><DD>How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity? and the scorners delight in their scorning, and fools hate knowledge?
<DT><A NAME="1:23">1:23</A><DD>Turn you at my reproof: behold, I will pour out my spirit unto you, I will make known my words unto you.
<DT><A NAME="1:24">1:24</A><DD>Because I have called, and ye refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no man regarded;
<DT><A NAME="1:25">1:25</A><DD>But ye have set at nought all my counsel, and would none of my reproof:
<DT><A NAME="1:26">1:26</A><DD>I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your fear cometh;
<DT><A NAME="1:27">1:27</A><DD>When your fear cometh as desolation, and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind; when distress and anguish cometh upon you.
<DT><A NAME="1:28">1:28</A><DD>Then shall they call upon me, but I will not answer; they shall seek me early, but they shall not find me:
<DT><A NAME="1:29">1:29</A><DD>For that they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of the LORD:
<DT><A NAME="1:30">1:30</A><DD>They would none of my counsel: they despised all my reproof.
<DT><A NAME="1:31">1:31</A><DD>Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own devices.
<DT><A NAME="1:32">1:32</A><DD>For the turning away of the simple shall slay them, and the prosperity of fools shall destroy them.
<DT><A NAME="1:33">1:33</A><DD>But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely, and shall be quiet from fear of evil.

<DT><A NAME="2:3">2:3</A><DD>Yea, if thou criest after knowledge, <I>and</I> liftest up thy voice for understanding;
<DT><A NAME="2:4">2:4</A><DD>If thou seekest her as silver, and searchest for her as <I>for</I> hid treasures;
<DT><A NAME="2:5">2:5</A><DD>Then shalt thou understand the fear of the LORD, and find the knowledge of God.
<DT><A NAME="2:6">2:6</A><DD>For the LORD giveth wisdom: out of his mouth <I>cometh</I> knowledge and understanding.
<DT><A NAME="2:7">2:7</A><DD>He layeth up sound wisdom for the righteous: <I>he is</I> a buckler to them that walk uprightly.
<DT><A NAME="2:8">2:8</A><DD>He keepeth the paths of judgment, and preserveth the way of his saints.
<DT><A NAME="2:9">2:9</A><DD>Then shalt thou understand righteousness, and judgment, and equity; <I>yea</I>, every good path.
<DT><A NAME="2:10">2:10</A><DD>When wisdom entereth into thine heart, and knowledge is pleasant unto thy soul;
<DT><A NAME="2:11">2:11</A><DD>Discretion shall preserve thee, understanding shall keep thee:
<DT><A NAME="2:12">2:12</A><DD>To deliver thee from the way of the evil <I>man</I>, from the man that speaketh froward things;
<DT><A NAME="2:13">2:13</A><DD>Who leave the paths of uprightness, to walk in the ways of darkness;
<DT><A NAME="2:14">2:14</A><DD>Who rejoice to do evil, <I>and</I> delight in the frowardness of the wicked;
<DT><A NAME="2:15">2:15</A><DD>Whose ways <I>are</I> crooked, and <I>they</I> froward in their paths:
<DT><A NAME="2:16">2:16</A><DD>To deliver thee from the strange woman, <I>even</I> from the stranger <I>which</I> flattereth with her words;
<DT><A NAME="2:17">2:17</A><DD>Which forsaketh the guide of her youth, and forgetteth the covenant of her God.
<DT><A NAME="2:18">2:18</A><DD>For her house inclineth unto death, and her paths unto the dead.
<DT><A NAME="2:19">2:19</A><DD>None that go unto her return again, neither take they hold of the paths of life.
<DT><A NAME="2:20">2:20</A><DD>That thou mayest walk in the way of good <I>men</I>, and keep the paths of the righteous.
<DT><A NAME="2:21">2:21</A><DD>For the upright shall dwell in the land, and the perfect shall remain in it.
<DT><A NAME="2:22">2:22</A><DD>But the wicked shall be cut off from the earth, and the transgressors shall be rooted out of it.

<DT><A NAME="3:2">3:2</A><DD>For length of days, and long life, and peace, shall they add to thee.
<DT><A NAME="3:3">3:3</A><DD>Let not mercy and truth forsake thee: bind them about thy neck; write them upon the table of thine heart:
<DT><A NAME="3:4">3:4</A><DD>So shalt thou find favour and good understanding in the sight of God and man.
<DT><A NAME="3:5">3:5</A><DD>Trust in the LORD with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding.
<DT><A NAME="3:6">3:6</A><DD>In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.
<DT><A NAME="3:7">3:7</A><DD>Be not wise in thine own eyes: fear the LORD, and depart from evil.
<DT><A NAME="3:8">3:8</A><DD>It shall be health to thy navel, and marrow to thy bones.
<DT><A NAME="3:9">3:9</A><DD>Honour the LORD with thy substance, and with the firstfruits of all thine increase:
<DT><A NAME="3:10">3:10</A><DD>So shall thy barns be filled with plenty, and thy presses shall burst out with new wine.
<DT><A NAME="3:11">3:11</A><DD>My son, despise not the chastening of the LORD; neither be weary of his correction:
<DT><A NAME="3:12">3:12</A><DD>For whom the LORD loveth he correcteth; even as a father the son <I>in whom</I> he delighteth.
<DT><A NAME="3:13">3:13</A><DD>Happy <I>is</I> the man <I>that</I> findeth wisdom, and the man <I>that</I> getteth understanding.
<DT><A NAME="3:14">3:14</A><DD>For the merchandise of it <I>is</I> better than the merchandise of silver, and the gain thereof than fine gold.
<DT><A NAME="3:15">3:15</A><DD>She <I>is</I> more precious than rubies: and all the things thou canst desire are not to be compared unto her.
<DT><A NAME="3:16">3:16</A><DD>Length of days <I>is</I> in her right hand; <I>and</I> in her left hand riches and honour.
<DT><A NAME="3:17">3:17</A><DD>Her ways <I>are</I> ways of pleasantness, and all her paths <I>are</I> peace.
<DT><A NAME="3:18">3:18</A><DD>She <I>is</I> a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her: and happy <I>is every one</I> that retaineth her.
<DT><A NAME="3:19">3:19</A><DD>The LORD by wisdom hath founded the earth; by understanding hath he established the heavens.
<DT><A NAME="3:20">3:20</A><DD>By his knowledge the depths are broken up, and the clouds drop down the dew.
<DT><A NAME="3:21">3:21</A><DD>My son, let not them depart from thine eyes: keep sound wisdom and discretion:
<DT><A NAME="3:22">3:22</A><DD>So shall they be life unto thy soul, and grace to thy neck.
<DT><A NAME="3:23">3:23</A><DD>Then shalt thou walk in thy way safely, and thy foot shall not stumble.
<DT><A NAME="3:24">3:24</A><DD>When thou liest down, thou shalt not be afraid: yea, thou shalt lie down, and thy sleep shall be sweet.
<DT><A NAME="3:25">3:25</A><DD>Be not afraid of sudden fear, neither of the desolation of the wicked, when it cometh.
<DT><A NAME="3:26">3:26</A><DD>For the LORD shall be thy confidence, and shall keep thy foot from being taken.
<DT><A NAME="3:27">3:27</A><DD>Withhold not good from them to whom it is due, when it is in the power of thine hand to do <I>it</I>.
<DT><A NAME="3:28">3:28</A><DD>Say not unto thy neighbour, Go, and come again, and to morrow I will give; when thou hast it by thee.

<DT><A NAME="3:31">3:31</A><DD>Envy thou not the oppressor, and choose none of his ways.
<DT><A NAME="3:32">3:32</A><DD>For the froward <I>is</I> abomination to the LORD: but his secret <I>is</I> with the righteous.
<DT><A NAME="3:33">3:33</A><DD>The curse of the LORD <I>is</I> in the house of the wicked: but he blesseth the habitation of the just.
<DT><A NAME="3:34">3:34</A><DD>Surely he scorneth the scorners: but he giveth grace unto the lowly.
