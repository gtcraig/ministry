<H2>Chapter 1</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="1:1">1:1</A><DD>Now king David was old <I>and</I> stricken in years; and they covered him with clothes, but he gat no heat.
<DT><A NAME="1:2">1:2</A><DD>Wherefore his servants said unto him, Let there be sought for my lord the king a young virgin: and let her stand before the king, and let her cherish him, and let her lie in thy bosom, that my lord the king may get heat.
<DT><A NAME="1:3">1:3</A><DD>So they sought for a fair damsel throughout all the coasts of Israel, and found Abishag a Shunammite, and brought her to the king.
<DT><A NAME="1:4">1:4</A><DD>And the damsel <I>was</I> very fair, and cherished the king, and ministered to him: but the king knew her not.
<DT><A NAME="1:5">1:5</A><DD>Then Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself, saying, I will be king: and he prepared him chariots and horsemen, and fifty men to run before him.
<DT><A NAME="1:6">1:6</A><DD>And his father had not displeased him at any time in saying, Why hast thou done so? and he also <I>was a</I> very goodly <I>man</I>; and <I>his mother</I> bare him after Absalom.
<DT><A NAME="1:7">1:7</A><DD>And he conferred with Joab the son of Zeruiah, and with Abiathar the priest: and they following Adonijah helped <I>him</I>.
<DT><A NAME="1:8">1:8</A><DD>But Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and Nathan the prophet, and Shimei, and Rei, and the mighty men which <I>belonged</I> to David, were not with Adonijah.
<DT><A NAME="1:9">1:9</A><DD>And Adonijah slew sheep and oxen and fat cattle by the stone of Zoheleth, which <I>is</I> by Enrogel, and called all his brethren the king's sons, and all the men of Judah the king's servants:
<DT><A NAME="1:10">1:10</A><DD>But Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah, and the mighty men, and Solomon his brother, he called not.
<DT><A NAME="1:11">1:11</A><DD>Wherefore Nathan spake unto Bathsheba the mother of Solomon, saying, Hast thou not heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith doth reign, and David our lord knoweth <I>it</I> not?
<DT><A NAME="1:12">1:12</A><DD>Now therefore come, let me, I pray thee, give thee counsel, that thou mayest save thine own life, and the life of thy son Solomon.
<DT><A NAME="1:13">1:13</A><DD>Go and get thee in unto king David, and say unto him, Didst not thou, my lord, O king, swear unto thine handmaid, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne? why then doth Adonijah reign?
<DT><A NAME="1:14">1:14</A><DD>Behold, while thou yet talkest there with the king, I also will come in after thee, and confirm thy words.
<DT><A NAME="1:15">1:15</A><DD>And Bathsheba went in unto the king into the chamber: and the king was very old; and Abishag the Shunammite ministered unto the king.
<DT><A NAME="1:16">1:16</A><DD>And Bathsheba bowed, and did obeisance unto the king. And the king said, What wouldest thou?
<DT><A NAME="1:17">1:17</A><DD>And she said unto him, My lord, thou swarest by the LORD thy God unto thine handmaid, <I>saying</I>, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne.
<DT><A NAME="1:18">1:18</A><DD>And now, behold, Adonijah reigneth; and now, my lord the king, thou knowest <I>it</I> not:
<DT><A NAME="1:19">1:19</A><DD>And he hath slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance, and hath called all the sons of the king, and Abiathar the priest, and Joab the captain of the host: but Solomon thy servant hath he not called.
<DT><A NAME="1:20">1:20</A><DD>And thou, my lord, O king, the eyes of all Israel <I>are</I> upon thee, that thou shouldest tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him.
<DT><A NAME="1:21">1:21</A><DD>Otherwise it shall come to pass, when my lord the king shall sleep with his fathers, that I and my son Solomon shall be counted offenders.
<DT><A NAME="1:22">1:22</A><DD>And, lo, while she yet talked with the king, Nathan the prophet also came in.
<DT><A NAME="1:23">1:23</A><DD>And they told the king, saying, Behold Nathan the prophet. And when he was come in before the king, he bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground.
<DT><A NAME="1:24">1:24</A><DD>And Nathan said, My lord, O king, hast thou said, Adonijah shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne?
<DT><A NAME="1:25">1:25</A><DD>For he is gone down this day, and hath slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance, and hath called all the king's sons, and the captains of the host, and Abiathar the priest; and, behold, they eat and drink before him, and say, God save king Adonijah.
<DT><A NAME="1:26">1:26</A><DD>But me, <I>even</I> me thy servant, and Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and thy servant Solomon, hath he not called.
<DT><A NAME="1:27">1:27</A><DD>Is this thing done by my lord the king, and thou hast not shewed <I>it</I> unto thy servant, who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him?
<DT><A NAME="1:28">1:28</A><DD>Then king David answered and said, Call me Bathsheba. And she came into the king's presence, and stood before the king.
<DT><A NAME="1:29">1:29</A><DD>And the king sware, and said, <I>As</I> the LORD liveth, that hath redeemed my soul out of all distress,
<DT><A NAME="1:30">1:30</A><DD>Even as I sware unto thee by the LORD God of Israel, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne in my stead; even so will I certainly do this day.
<DT><A NAME="1:31">1:31</A><DD>Then Bathsheba bowed with <I>her</I> face to the earth, and did reverence to the king, and said, Let my lord king David live for ever.
<DT><A NAME="1:32">1:32</A><DD>And king David said, Call me Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada. And they came before the king.
<DT><A NAME="1:33">1:33</A><DD>The king also said unto them, Take with you the servants of your lord, and cause Solomon my son to ride upon mine own mule, and bring him down to Gihon:
<DT><A NAME="1:34">1:34</A><DD>And let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him there king over Israel: and blow ye with the trumpet, and say, God save king Solomon.
<DT><A NAME="1:35">1:35</A><DD>Then ye shall come up after him, that he may come and sit upon my throne; for he shall be king in my stead: and I have appointed him to be ruler over Israel and over Judah.
<DT><A NAME="1:36">1:36</A><DD>And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king, and said, Amen: the LORD God of my lord the king say so <I>too</I>.
<DT><A NAME="1:37">1:37</A><DD>As the LORD hath been with my lord the king, even so be he with Solomon, and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord king David.
<DT><A NAME="1:38">1:38</A><DD>So Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, went down, and caused Solomon to ride upon king David's mule, and brought him to Gihon.
<DT><A NAME="1:39">1:39</A><DD>And Zadok the priest took an horn of oil out of the tabernacle, and anointed Solomon. And they blew the trumpet; and all the people said, God save king Solomon.
<DT><A NAME="1:40">1:40</A><DD>And all the people came up after him, and the people piped with pipes, and rejoiced with great joy, so that the earth rent with the sound of them.
<DT><A NAME="1:41">1:41</A><DD>And Adonijah and all the guests that <I>were</I> with him heard <I>it</I> as they had made an end of eating. And when Joab heard the sound of the trumpet, he said, Wherefore <I>is this</I> noise of the city being in an uproar?
<DT><A NAME="1:42">1:42</A><DD>And while he yet spake, behold, Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest came: and Adonijah said unto him, Come in; for thou <I>art</I> a valiant man, and bringest good tidings.
<DT><A NAME="1:43">1:43</A><DD>And Jonathan answered and said to Adonijah, Verily our lord king David hath made Solomon king.
<DT><A NAME="1:44">1:44</A><DD>And the king hath sent with him Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, and they have caused him to ride upon the king's mule:
<DT><A NAME="1:45">1:45</A><DD>And Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king in Gihon: and they are come up from thence rejoicing, so that the city rang again. This <I>is</I> the noise that ye have heard.
<DT><A NAME="1:46">1:46</A><DD>And also Solomon sitteth on the throne of the kingdom.
<DT><A NAME="1:47">1:47</A><DD>And moreover the king's servants came to bless our lord king David, saying, God make the name of Solomon better than thy name, and make his throne greater than thy throne. And the king bowed himself upon the bed.
<DT><A NAME="1:48">1:48</A><DD>And also thus said the king, Blessed <I>be</I> the LORD God of Israel, which hath given <I>one</I> to sit on my throne this day, mine eyes even seeing <I>it</I>.
<DT><A NAME="1:49">1:49</A><DD>And all the guests that <I>were</I> with Adonijah were afraid, and rose up, and went every man his way.
<DT><A NAME="1:50">1:50</A><DD>And Adonijah feared because of Solomon, and arose, and went, and caught hold on the horns of the altar.
<DT><A NAME="1:51">1:51</A><DD>And it was told Solomon, saying, Behold, Adonijah feareth king Solomon: for, lo, he hath caught hold on the horns of the altar, saying, Let king Solomon swear unto me to day that he will not slay his servant with the sword.
<DT><A NAME="1:52">1:52</A><DD>And Solomon said, If he will shew himself a worthy man, there shall not an hair of him fall to the earth: but if wickedness shall be found in him, he shall die.
<DT><A NAME="1:53">1:53</A><DD>So king Solomon sent, and they brought him down from the altar. And he came and bowed himself to king Solomon: and Solomon said unto him, Go to thine house.
</DL></DIV><H2>Chapter 2</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="2:1">2:1</A><DD>Now the days of David drew nigh that he should die; and he charged Solomon his son, saying,
<DT><A NAME="2:2">2:2</A><DD>I go the way of all the earth: be thou strong therefore, and shew thyself a man;
<DT><A NAME="2:3">2:3</A><DD>And keep the charge of the LORD thy God, to walk in his ways, to keep his statutes, and his commandments, and his judgments, and his testimonies, as it is written in the law of Moses, that thou mayest prosper in all that thou doest, and whithersoever thou turnest thyself:
<DT><A NAME="2:4">2:4</A><DD>That the LORD may continue his word which he spake concerning me, saying, If thy children take heed to their way, to walk before me in truth with all their heart and with all their soul, there shall not fail thee (said he) a man on the throne of Israel.
<DT><A NAME="2:5">2:5</A><DD>Moreover thou knowest also what Joab the son of Zeruiah did to me, <I>and</I> what he did to the two captains of the hosts of Israel, unto Abner the son of Ner, and unto Amasa the son of Jether, whom he slew, and shed the blood of war in peace, and put the blood of war upon his girdle that <I>was</I> about his loins, and in his shoes that <I>were</I> on his feet.
<DT><A NAME="2:6">2:6</A><DD>Do therefore according to thy wisdom, and let not his hoar head go down to the grave in peace.
<DT><A NAME="2:7">2:7</A><DD>But shew kindness unto the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite, and let them be of those that eat at thy table: for so they came to me when I fled because of Absalom thy brother.
<DT><A NAME="2:8">2:8</A><DD>And, behold, <I>thou hast</I> with thee Shimei the son of Gera, a Benjamite of Bahurim, which cursed me with a grievous curse in the day when I went to Mahanaim: but he came down to meet me at Jordan, and I sware to him by the LORD, saying, I will not put thee to death with the sword.
<DT><A NAME="2:9">2:9</A><DD>Now therefore hold him not guiltless: for thou <I>art</I> a wise man, and knowest what thou oughtest to do unto him; but his hoar head bring thou down to the grave with blood.
<DT><A NAME="2:10">2:10</A><DD>So David slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David.
<DT><A NAME="2:11">2:11</A><DD>And the days that David reigned over Israel <I>were</I> forty years: seven years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three years reigned he in Jerusalem.
<DT><A NAME="2:12">2:12</A><DD>Then sat Solomon upon the throne of David his father; and his kingdom was established greatly.
<DT><A NAME="2:13">2:13</A><DD>And Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon. And she said, Comest thou peaceably? And he said, Peaceably.
<DT><A NAME="2:14">2:14</A><DD>He said moreover, I have somewhat to say unto thee. And she said, Say on.
<DT><A NAME="2:15">2:15</A><DD>And he said, Thou knowest that the kingdom was mine, and <I>that</I> all Israel set their faces on me, that I should reign: howbeit the kingdom is turned about, and is become my brother's: for it was his from the LORD.
<DT><A NAME="2:16">2:16</A><DD>And now I ask one petition of thee, deny me not. And she said unto him, Say on.
<DT><A NAME="2:17">2:17</A><DD>And he said, Speak, I pray thee, unto Solomon the king, (for he will not say thee nay,) that he give me Abishag the Shunammite to wife.
<DT><A NAME="2:18">2:18</A><DD>And Bathsheba said, Well; I will speak for thee unto the king.
<DT><A NAME="2:19">2:19</A><DD>Bathsheba therefore went unto king Solomon, to speak unto him for Adonijah. And the king rose up to meet her, and bowed himself unto her, and sat down on his throne, and caused a seat to be set for the king's mother; and she sat on his right hand.
<DT><A NAME="2:20">2:20</A><DD>Then she said, I desire one small petition of thee; <I>I pray thee</I>, say me not nay. And the king said unto her, Ask on, my mother: for I will not say thee nay.
<DT><A NAME="2:21">2:21</A><DD>And she said, Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah thy brother to wife.
<DT><A NAME="2:22">2:22</A><DD>And king Solomon answered and said unto his mother, And why dost thou ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? ask for him the kingdom also; for he <I>is</I> mine elder brother; even for him, and for Abiathar the priest, and for Joab the son of Zeruiah.
<DT><A NAME="2:23">2:23</A><DD>Then king Solomon sware by the LORD, saying, God do so to me, and more also, if Adonijah have not spoken this word against his own life.
<DT><A NAME="2:24">2:24</A><DD>Now therefore, <I>as</I> the LORD liveth, which hath established me, and set me on the throne of David my father, and who hath made me an house, as he promised, Adonijah shall be put to death this day.
<DT><A NAME="2:25">2:25</A><DD>And king Solomon sent by the hand of Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; and he fell upon him that he died.
<DT><A NAME="2:26">2:26</A><DD>And unto Abiathar the priest said the king, Get thee to Anathoth, unto thine own fields; for thou <I>art</I> worthy of death: but I will not at this time put thee to death, because thou barest the ark of the Lord GOD before David my father, and because thou hast been afflicted in all wherein my father was afflicted.
<DT><A NAME="2:27">2:27</A><DD>So Solomon thrust out Abiathar from being priest unto the LORD; that he might fulfil the word of the LORD, which he spake concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh.
<DT><A NAME="2:28">2:28</A><DD>Then tidings came to Joab: for Joab had turned after Adonijah, though he turned not after Absalom. And Joab fled unto the tabernacle of the LORD, and caught hold on the horns of the altar.
<DT><A NAME="2:29">2:29</A><DD>And it was told king Solomon that Joab was fled unto the tabernacle of the LORD; and, behold, <I>he is</I> by the altar. Then Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, saying, Go, fall upon him.
<DT><A NAME="2:30">2:30</A><DD>And Benaiah came to the tabernacle of the LORD, and said unto him, Thus saith the king, Come forth. And he said, Nay; but I will die here. And Benaiah brought the king word again, saying, Thus said Joab, and thus he answered me.
<DT><A NAME="2:31">2:31</A><DD>And the king said unto him, Do as he hath said, and fall upon him, and bury him; that thou mayest take away the innocent blood, which Joab shed, from me, and from the house of my father.
<DT><A NAME="2:32">2:32</A><DD>And the LORD shall return his blood upon his own head, who fell upon two men more righteous and better than he, and slew them with the sword, my father David not knowing <I>thereof, to wit</I>, Abner the son of Ner, captain of the host of Israel, and Amasa the son of Jether, captain of the host of Judah.
<DT><A NAME="2:33">2:33</A><DD>Their blood shall therefore return upon the head of Joab, and upon the head of his seed for ever: but upon David, and upon his seed, and upon his house, and upon his throne, shall there be peace for ever from the LORD.
<DT><A NAME="2:34">2:34</A><DD>So Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up, and fell upon him, and slew him: and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness.
<DT><A NAME="2:35">2:35</A><DD>And the king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his room over the host: and Zadok the priest did the king put in the room of Abiathar.
<DT><A NAME="2:36">2:36</A><DD>And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him, Build thee an house in Jerusalem, and dwell there, and go not forth thence any whither.
<DT><A NAME="2:37">2:37</A><DD>For it shall be, <I>that</I> on the day thou goest out, and passest over the brook Kidron, thou shalt know for certain that thou shalt surely die: thy blood shall be upon thine own head.
<DT><A NAME="2:38">2:38</A><DD>And Shimei said unto the king, The saying <I>is</I> good: as my lord the king hath said, so will thy servant do. And Shimei dwelt in Jerusalem many days.
<DT><A NAME="2:39">2:39</A><DD>And it came to pass at the end of three years, that two of the servants of Shimei ran away unto Achish son of Maachah king of Gath. And they told Shimei, saying, Behold, thy servants <I>be</I> in Gath.
<DT><A NAME="2:40">2:40</A><DD>And Shimei arose, and saddled his ass, and went to Gath to Achish to seek his servants: and Shimei went, and brought his servants from Gath.
<DT><A NAME="2:41">2:41</A><DD>And it was told Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath, and was come again.
<DT><A NAME="2:42">2:42</A><DD>And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him, Did I not make thee to swear by the LORD, and protested unto thee, saying, Know for a certain, on the day thou goest out, and walkest abroad any whither, that thou shalt surely die? and thou saidst unto me, The word <I>that</I> I have heard <I>is</I> good.
<DT><A NAME="2:43">2:43</A><DD>Why then hast thou not kept the oath of the LORD, and the commandment that I have charged thee with?
<DT><A NAME="2:44">2:44</A><DD>The king said moreover to Shimei, Thou knowest all the wickedness which thine heart is privy to, that thou didst to David my father: therefore the LORD shall return thy wickedness upon thine own head;
<DT><A NAME="2:45">2:45</A><DD>And king Solomon <I>shall be</I> blessed, and the throne of David shall be established before the LORD for ever.
<DT><A NAME="2:46">2:46</A><DD>So the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; which went out, and fell upon him, that he died. And the kingdom was established in the hand of Solomon.
</DL></DIV><H2>Chapter 3</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="3:1">3:1</A><DD>And Solomon made affinity with Pharaoh king of Egypt, and took Pharaoh's daughter, and brought her into the city of David, until he had made an end of building his own house, and the house of the LORD, and the wall of Jerusalem round about.

<DT><A NAME="3:3">3:3</A><DD>And Solomon loved the LORD, walking in the statutes of David his father: only he sacrificed and burnt incense in high places.
<DT><A NAME="3:4">3:4</A><DD>And the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there; for that <I>was</I> the great high place: a thousand burnt offerings did Solomon offer upon that altar.

<DT><A NAME="3:21">3:21</A><DD>And when I rose in the morning to give my child suck, behold, it was dead: but when I had considered it in the morning, behold, it was not my son, which I did bear.
<DT><A NAME="3:22">3:22</A><DD>And the other woman said, Nay; but the living <I>is</I> my son, and the dead <I>is</I> thy son. And this said, No; but the dead <I>is</I> thy son, and the living <I>is</I> my son. Thus they spake before the king.
<DT><A NAME="3:23">3:23</A><DD>Then said the king, The one saith, This <I>is</I> my son that liveth, and thy son <I>is</I> the dead: and the other saith, Nay; but thy son <I>is</I> the dead, and my son <I>is</I> the living.
<DT><A NAME="3:24">3:24</A><DD>And the king said, Bring me a sword. And they brought a sword before the king.
<DT><A NAME="3:25">3:25</A><DD>And the king said, Divide the living child in two, and give half to the one, and half to the other.
<DT><A NAME="3:26">3:26</A><DD>Then spake the woman whose the living child <I>was</I> unto the king, for her bowels yearned upon her son, and she said, O my lord, give her the living child, and in no wise slay it. But the other said, Let it be neither mine nor thine, <I>but</I> divide <I>it</I>.
<DT><A NAME="3:27">3:27</A><DD>Then the king answered and said, Give her the living child, and in no wise slay it: she <I>is</I> the mother thereof.
<DT><A NAME="3:28">3:28</A><DD>And all Israel heard of the judgment which the king had judged; and they feared the king: for they saw that the wisdom of God <I>was</I> in him, to do judgment.

<DT><A NAME="6:7">6:7</A><DD>And the house, when it was in building, was built of stone made ready before it was brought thither: so that there was neither hammer nor axe <I>nor</I> any tool of iron heard in the house, while it was in building.

<DT><A NAME="7:18">7:18</A><DD>And he made the pillars, and two rows round about upon the one network, to cover the chapiters that <I>were</I> upon the top, with pomegranates: and so did he for the other chapiter.
<DT><A NAME="7:19">7:19</A><DD>And the chapiters that <I>were</I> upon the top of the pillars <I>were</I> of lily work in the porch, four cubits.
<DT><A NAME="7:20">7:20</A><DD>And the chapiters upon the two pillars <I>had pomegranates</I> also above, over against the belly which <I>was</I> by the network: and the pomegranates <I>were</I> two hundred in rows round about upon the other chapiter.
<DT><A NAME="7:21">7:21</A><DD>And he set up the pillars in the porch of the temple: and he set up the right pillar, and called the name thereof Jachin: and he set up the left pillar, and called the name thereof Boaz.
<DT><A NAME="7:22">7:22</A><DD>And upon the top of the pillars <I>was</I> lily work: so was the work of the pillars finished.
<DT><A NAME="7:23">7:23</A><DD>And he made a molten sea, ten cubits from the one brim to the other: <I>it was</I> round all about, and his height <I>was</I> five cubits: and a line of thirty cubits did compass it round about.
<DT><A NAME="7:24">7:24</A><DD>And under the brim of it round about <I>there were</I> knops compassing it, ten in a cubit, compassing the sea round about: the knops <I>were</I> cast in two rows, when it was cast.
<DT><A NAME="7:25">7:25</A><DD>It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east: and the sea <I>was set</I> above upon them, and all their hinder parts <I>were</I> inward.
<DT><A NAME="7:26">7:26</A><DD>And it <I>was</I> an hand breadth thick, and the brim thereof was wrought like the brim of a cup, with flowers of lilies: it contained two thousand baths.
<DT><A NAME="7:27">7:27</A><DD>And he made ten bases of brass; four cubits <I>was</I> the length of one base, and four cubits the breadth thereof, and three cubits the height of it.
<DT><A NAME="7:28">7:28</A><DD>And the work of the bases <I>was</I> on this <I>manner</I>: they had borders, and the borders <I>were</I> between the ledges:
<DT><A NAME="7:29">7:29</A><DD>And on the borders that <I>were</I> between the ledges <I>were</I> lions, oxen, and cherubims: and upon the ledges <I>there was</I> a base above: and beneath the lions and oxen <I>were</I> certain additions made of thin work.
<DT><A NAME="7:30">7:30</A><DD>And every base had four brasen wheels, and plates of brass: and the four corners thereof had undersetters: under the laver <I>were</I> undersetters molten, at the side of every addition.
<DT><A NAME="7:31">7:31</A><DD>And the mouth of it within the chapiter and above <I>was</I> a cubit: but the mouth thereof <I>was</I> round <I>after</I> the work of the base, a cubit and an half: and also upon the mouth of it <I>were</I> gravings with their borders, foursquare, not round.
<DT><A NAME="7:32">7:32</A><DD>And under the borders <I>were</I> four wheels; and the axletrees of the wheels <I>were joined</I> to the base: and the height of a wheel <I>was</I> a cubit and half a cubit.
<DT><A NAME="7:33">7:33</A><DD>And the work of the wheels <I>was</I> like the work of a chariot wheel: their axletrees, and their naves, and their felloes, and their spokes, <I>were</I> all molten.
<DT><A NAME="7:34">7:34</A><DD>And <I>there were</I> four undersetters to the four corners of one base: <I>and</I> the undersetters <I>were</I> of the very base itself.
<DT><A NAME="7:35">7:35</A><DD>And in the top of the base <I>was there</I> a round compass of half a cubit high: and on the top of the base the ledges thereof and the borders thereof <I>were</I> of the same.
<DT><A NAME="7:36">7:36</A><DD>For on the plates of the ledges thereof, and on the borders thereof, he graved cherubims, lions, and palm trees, according to the proportion of every one, and additions round about.
<DT><A NAME="7:37">7:37</A><DD>After this <I>manner</I> he made the ten bases: all of them had one casting, one measure, <I>and</I> one size.
<DT><A NAME="7:38">7:38</A><DD>Then made he ten lavers of brass: one laver contained forty baths: <I>and</I> every laver was four cubits: <I>and</I> upon every one of the ten bases one laver.
<DT><A NAME="7:39">7:39</A><DD>And he put five bases on the right side of the house, and five on the left side of the house: and he set the sea on the right side of the house eastward over against the south.
<DT><A NAME="7:40">7:40</A><DD>And Hiram made the lavers, and the shovels, and the basons. So Hiram made an end of doing all the work that he made king Solomon for the house of the LORD:
<DT><A NAME="7:41">7:41</A><DD>The two pillars, and the <I>two</I> bowls of the chapiters that <I>were</I> on the top of the two pillars; and the two networks, to cover the two bowls of the chapiters which <I>were</I> upon the top of the pillars;
<DT><A NAME="7:42">7:42</A><DD>And four hundred pomegranates for the two networks, <I>even</I> two rows of pomegranates for one network, to cover the two bowls of the chapiters that <I>were</I> upon the pillars;
<DT><A NAME="7:43">7:43</A><DD>And the ten bases, and ten lavers on the bases;
<DT><A NAME="7:44">7:44</A><DD>And one sea, and twelve oxen under the sea;
<DT><A NAME="7:45">7:45</A><DD>And the pots, and the shovels, and the basons: and all these vessels, which Hiram made to king Solomon for the house of the LORD, <I>were of</I> bright brass.
<DT><A NAME="7:46">7:46</A><DD>In the plain of Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zarthan.
<DT><A NAME="7:47">7:47</A><DD>And Solomon left all the vessels <I>unweighed</I>, because they were exceeding many: neither was the weight of the brass found out.
<DT><A NAME="7:48">7:48</A><DD>And Solomon made all the vessels that <I>pertained</I> unto the house of the LORD: the altar of gold, and the table of gold, whereupon the shewbread <I>was</I>,
<DT><A NAME="7:49">7:49</A><DD>And the candlesticks of pure gold, five on the right <I>side</I>, and five on the left, before the oracle, with the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs <I>of</I> gold,
<DT><A NAME="7:50">7:50</A><DD>And the bowls, and the snuffers, and the basons, and the spoons, and the censers <I>of</I> pure gold; and the hinges <I>of</I> gold, <I>both</I> for the doors of the inner house, the most holy <I>place, and</I> for the doors of the house, <I>to wit</I>, of the temple.
<DT><A NAME="7:51">7:51</A><DD>So was ended all the work that king Solomon made for the house of the LORD. And Solomon brought in the things which David his father had dedicated; <I>even</I> the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, did he put among the treasures of the house of the LORD.

<DT><A NAME="8:54">8:54</A><DD>And it was <I>so</I>, that when Solomon had made an end of praying all this prayer and supplication unto the LORD, he arose from before the altar of the LORD, from kneeling on his knees with his hands spread up to heaven.

<DT><A NAME="9:25">9:25</A><DD>And three times in a year did Solomon offer burnt offerings and peace offerings upon the altar which he built unto the LORD, and he burnt incense upon the altar that <I>was</I> before the LORD. So he finished the house.
<DT><A NAME="9:26">9:26</A><DD>And king Solomon made a navy of ships in Eziongeber, which <I>is</I> beside Eloth, on the shore of the Red sea, in the land of Edom.

<DT><A NAME="10:1">10:1</A><DD>And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon concerning the name of the LORD, she came to prove him with hard questions.
<DT><A NAME="10:2">10:2</A><DD>And she came to Jerusalem with a very great train, with camels that bare spices, and very much gold, and precious stones: and when she was come to Solomon, she communed with him of all that was in her heart.
<DT><A NAME="10:3">10:3</A><DD>And Solomon told her all her questions: there was not <I>any</I> thing hid from the king, which he told her not.
<DT><A NAME="10:4">10:4</A><DD>And when the queen of Sheba had seen all Solomon's wisdom, and the house that he had built,

<DT><A NAME="10:6">10:6</A><DD>And she said to the king, It was a true report that I heard in mine own land of thy acts and of thy wisdom.
<DT><A NAME="10:7">10:7</A><DD>Howbeit I believed not the words, until I came, and mine eyes had seen <I>it</I>: and, behold, the half was not told me: thy wisdom and prosperity exceedeth the fame which I heard.
<DT><A NAME="10:8">10:8</A><DD>Happy <I>are</I> thy men, happy <I>are</I> these thy servants, which stand continually before thee, <I>and</I> that hear thy wisdom.
<DT><A NAME="10:9">10:9</A><DD>Blessed be the LORD thy God, which delighted in thee, to set thee on the throne of Israel: because the LORD loved Israel for ever, therefore made he thee king, to do judgment and justice.
<DT><A NAME="10:10">10:10</A><DD>And she gave the king an hundred and twenty talents of gold, and of spices very great store, and precious stones: there came no more such abundance of spices as these which the queen of Sheba gave to king Solomon.
<DT><A NAME="10:11">10:11</A><DD>And the navy also of Hiram, that brought gold from Ophir, brought in from Ophir great plenty of almug trees, and precious stones.
<DT><A NAME="10:12">10:12</A><DD>And the king made of the almug trees pillars for the house of the LORD, and for the king's house, harps also and psalteries for singers: there came no such almug trees, nor were seen unto this day.
<DT><A NAME="10:13">10:13</A><DD>And king Solomon gave unto the queen of Sheba all her desire, whatsoever she asked, beside <I>that</I> which Solomon gave her of his royal bounty. So she turned and went to her own country, she and her servants.
<DT><A NAME="10:14">10:14</A><DD>Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred threescore and six talents of gold,
<DT><A NAME="10:15">10:15</A><DD>Beside <I>that he had</I> of the merchantmen, and of the traffick of the spice merchants, and of all the kings of Arabia, and of the governors of the country.
<DT><A NAME="10:16">10:16</A><DD>And king Solomon made two hundred targets <I>of</I> beaten gold: six hundred <I>shekels</I> of gold went to one target.
<DT><A NAME="10:17">10:17</A><DD>And <I>he made</I> three hundred shields <I>of</I> beaten gold; three pound of gold went to one shield: and the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon.
<DT><A NAME="10:18">10:18</A><DD>Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with the best gold.
<DT><A NAME="10:19">10:19</A><DD>The throne had six steps, and the top of the throne <I>was</I> round behind: and <I>there were</I> stays on either side on the place of the seat, and two lions stood beside the stays.
<DT><A NAME="10:20">10:20</A><DD>And twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps: there was not the like made in any kingdom.
<DT><A NAME="10:21">10:21</A><DD>And all king Solomon's drinking vessels <I>were of</I> gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon <I>were of</I> pure gold; none <I>were of</I> silver: it was nothing accounted of in the days of Solomon.
<DT><A NAME="10:22">10:22</A><DD>For the king had at sea a navy of Tharshish with the navy of Hiram: once in three years came the navy of Tharshish, bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.
<DT><A NAME="10:23">10:23</A><DD>So king Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth for riches and for wisdom.
<DT><A NAME="10:24">10:24</A><DD>And all the earth sought to Solomon, to hear his wisdom, which God had put in his heart.
<DT><A NAME="10:25">10:25</A><DD>And they brought every man his present, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and garments, and armour, and spices, horses, and mules, a rate year by year.
<DT><A NAME="10:26">10:26</A><DD>And Solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen: and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, whom he bestowed in the cities for chariots, and with the king at Jerusalem.
<DT><A NAME="10:27">10:27</A><DD>And the king made silver <I>to be</I> in Jerusalem as stones, and cedars made he <I>to be</I> as the sycomore trees that <I>are</I> in the vale, for abundance.
<DT><A NAME="10:28">10:28</A><DD>And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and linen yarn: the king's merchants received the linen yarn at a price.
<DT><A NAME="10:29">10:29</A><DD>And a chariot came up and went out of Egypt for six hundred <I>shekels</I> of silver, and an horse for an hundred and fifty: and so for all the kings of the Hittites, and for the kings of Syria, did they bring <I>them</I> out by their means.

<DT><A NAME="11:1">11:1</A><DD>But king Solomon loved many strange women, together with the daughter of Pharaoh, women of the Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Zidonians, <I>and</I> Hittites;
<DT><A NAME="11:2">11:2</A><DD>Of the nations <I>concerning</I> which the LORD said unto the children of Israel, Ye shall not go in to them, neither shall they come in unto you: <I>for</I> surely they will turn away your heart after their gods: Solomon clave unto these in love.
<DT><A NAME="11:3">11:3</A><DD>And he had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred concubines: and his wives turned away his heart.
<DT><A NAME="11:4">11:4</A><DD>For it came to pass, when Solomon was old, <I>that</I> his wives turned away his heart after other gods: and his heart was not perfect with the LORD his God, as <I>was</I> the heart of David his father.
<DT><A NAME="11:5">11:5</A><DD>For Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, and after Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites.
<DT><A NAME="11:6">11:6</A><DD>And Solomon did evil in the sight of the LORD, and went not fully after the LORD, as <I>did</I> David his father.
<DT><A NAME="11:7">11:7</A><DD>Then did Solomon build an high place for Chemosh, the abomination of Moab, in the hill that <I>is</I> before Jerusalem, and for Molech, the abomination of the children of Ammon.
<DT><A NAME="11:8">11:8</A><DD>And likewise did he for all his strange wives, which burnt incense and sacrificed unto their gods.
<DT><A NAME="11:9">11:9</A><DD>And the LORD was angry with Solomon, because his heart was turned from the LORD God of Israel, which had appeared unto him twice,
<DT><A NAME="11:10">11:10</A><DD>And had commanded him concerning this thing, that he should not go after other gods: but he kept not that which the LORD commanded.
<DT><A NAME="11:11">11:11</A><DD>Wherefore the LORD said unto Solomon, Forasmuch as this is done of thee, and thou hast not kept my covenant and my statutes, which I have commanded thee, I will surely rend the kingdom from thee, and will give it to thy servant.
<DT><A NAME="11:12">11:12</A><DD>Notwithstanding in thy days I will not do it for David thy father's sake: <I>but</I> I will rend it out of the hand of thy son.
<DT><A NAME="11:13">11:13</A><DD>Howbeit I will not rend away all the kingdom; <I>but</I> will give one tribe to thy son for David my servant's sake, and for Jerusalem's sake which I have chosen.
<DT><A NAME="11:14">11:14</A><DD>And the LORD stirred up an adversary unto Solomon, Hadad the Edomite: he <I>was</I> of the king's seed in Edom.
<DT><A NAME="11:15">11:15</A><DD>For it came to pass, when David was in Edom, and Joab the captain of the host was gone up to bury the slain, after he had smitten every male in Edom;
<DT><A NAME="11:16">11:16</A><DD>(For six months did Joab remain there with all Israel, until he had cut off every male in Edom:)
<DT><A NAME="11:17">11:17</A><DD>That Hadad fled, he and certain Edomites of his father's servants with him, to go into Egypt; Hadad <I>being</I> yet a little child.
<DT><A NAME="11:18">11:18</A><DD>And they arose out of Midian, and came to Paran: and they took men with them out of Paran, and they came to Egypt, unto Pharaoh king of Egypt; which gave him an house, and appointed him victuals, and gave him land.
<DT><A NAME="11:19">11:19</A><DD>And Hadad found great favour in the sight of Pharaoh, so that he gave him to wife the sister of his own wife, the sister of Tahpenes the queen.
<DT><A NAME="11:20">11:20</A><DD>And the sister of Tahpenes bare him Genubath his son, whom Tahpenes weaned in Pharaoh's house: and Genubath was in Pharaoh's household among the sons of Pharaoh.
<DT><A NAME="11:21">11:21</A><DD>And when Hadad heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers, and that Joab the captain of the host was dead, Hadad said to Pharaoh, Let me depart, that I may go to mine own country.
<DT><A NAME="11:22">11:22</A><DD>Then Pharaoh said unto him, But what hast thou lacked with me, that, behold, thou seekest to go to thine own country? And he answered, Nothing: howbeit let me go in any wise.
<DT><A NAME="11:23">11:23</A><DD>And God stirred him up <I>another</I> adversary, Rezon the son of Eliadah, which fled from his lord Hadadezer king of Zobah:
<DT><A NAME="11:24">11:24</A><DD>And he gathered men unto him, and became captain over a band, when David slew them <I>of Zobah</I>: and they went to Damascus, and dwelt therein, and reigned in Damascus.
<DT><A NAME="11:25">11:25</A><DD>And he was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon, beside the mischief that Hadad <I>did</I>: and he abhorred Israel, and reigned over Syria.
<DT><A NAME="11:26">11:26</A><DD>And Jeroboam the son of Nebat, an Ephrathite of Zereda, Solomon's servant, whose mother's name <I>was</I> Zeruah, a widow woman, even he lifted up <I>his</I> hand against the king.
<DT><A NAME="11:27">11:27</A><DD>And this <I>was</I> the cause that he lifted up <I>his</I> hand against the king: Solomon built Millo, <I>and</I> repaired the breaches of the city of David his father.
<DT><A NAME="11:28">11:28</A><DD>And the man Jeroboam <I>was</I> a mighty man of valour: and Solomon seeing the young man that he was industrious, he made him ruler over all the charge of the house of Joseph.
<DT><A NAME="11:29">11:29</A><DD>And it came to pass at that time when Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem, that the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found him in the way; and he had clad himself with a new garment; and they two <I>were</I> alone in the field:
<DT><A NAME="11:30">11:30</A><DD>And Ahijah caught the new garment that <I>was</I> on him, and rent it <I>in</I> twelve pieces:
<DT><A NAME="11:31">11:31</A><DD>And he said to Jeroboam, Take thee ten pieces: for thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, Behold, I will rend the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon, and will give ten tribes to thee:
<DT><A NAME="11:32">11:32</A><DD>(But he shall have one tribe for my servant David's sake, and for Jerusalem's sake, the city which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel:)
<DT><A NAME="11:33">11:33</A><DD>Because that they have forsaken me, and have worshipped Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, Chemosh the god of the Moabites, and Milcom the god of the children of Ammon, and have not walked in my ways, to do <I>that which is</I> right in mine eyes, and <I>to keep</I> my statutes and my judgments, as <I>did</I> David his father.
<DT><A NAME="11:34">11:34</A><DD>Howbeit I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand: but I will make him prince all the days of his life for David my servant's sake, whom I chose, because he kept my commandments and my statutes:
<DT><A NAME="11:35">11:35</A><DD>But I will take the kingdom out of his son's hand, and will give it unto thee, <I>even</I> ten tribes.
<DT><A NAME="11:36">11:36</A><DD>And unto his son will I give one tribe, that David my servant may have a light alway before me in Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen me to put my name there.
<DT><A NAME="11:37">11:37</A><DD>And I will take thee, and thou shalt reign according to all that thy soul desireth, and shalt be king over Israel.
<DT><A NAME="11:38">11:38</A><DD>And it shall be, if thou wilt hearken unto all that I command thee, and wilt walk in my ways, and do <I>that is</I> right in my sight, to keep my statutes and my commandments, as David my servant did; that I will be with thee, and build thee a sure house, as I built for David, and will give Israel unto thee.
<DT><A NAME="11:39">11:39</A><DD>And I will for this afflict the seed of David, but not for ever.
<DT><A NAME="11:40">11:40</A><DD>Solomon sought therefore to kill Jeroboam. And Jeroboam arose, and fled into Egypt, unto Shishak king of Egypt, and was in Egypt until the death of Solomon.
<DT><A NAME="11:41">11:41</A><DD>And the rest of the acts of Solomon, and all that he did, and his wisdom, <I>are</I> they not written in the book of the acts of Solomon?

<DT><A NAME="12:1">12:1</A><DD>And Rehoboam went to Shechem: for all Israel were come to Shechem to make him king.
<DT><A NAME="12:2">12:2</A><DD>And it came to pass, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who was yet in Egypt, heard <I>of it</I>, (for he was fled from the presence of king Solomon, and Jeroboam dwelt in Egypt;)
<DT><A NAME="12:3">12:3</A><DD>That they sent and called him. And Jeroboam and all the congregation of Israel came, and spake unto Rehoboam, saying,
<DT><A NAME="12:4">12:4</A><DD>Thy father made our yoke grievous: now therefore make thou the grievous service of thy father, and his heavy yoke which he put upon us, lighter, and we will serve thee.
<DT><A NAME="12:5">12:5</A><DD>And he said unto them, Depart yet <I>for</I> three days, then come again to me. And the people departed.
<DT><A NAME="12:6">12:6</A><DD>And king Rehoboam consulted with the old men, that stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived, and said, How do ye advise that I may answer this people?
<DT><A NAME="12:7">12:7</A><DD>And they spake unto him, saying, If thou wilt be a servant unto this people this day, and wilt serve them, and answer them, and speak good words to them, then they will be thy servants for ever.
<DT><A NAME="12:8">12:8</A><DD>But he forsook the counsel of the old men, which they had given him, and consulted with the young men that were grown up with him, <I>and</I> which stood before him:
<DT><A NAME="12:9">12:9</A><DD>And he said unto them, What counsel give ye that we may answer this people, who have spoken to me, saying, Make the yoke which thy father did put upon us lighter?
<DT><A NAME="12:10">12:10</A><DD>And the young men that were grown up with him spake unto him, saying, Thus shalt thou speak unto this people that spake unto thee, saying, Thy father made our yoke heavy, but make thou <I>it</I> lighter unto us; thus shalt thou say unto them, My little <I>finger</I> shall be thicker than my father's loins.
<DT><A NAME="12:11">12:11</A><DD>And now whereas my father did lade you with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke: my father hath chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.
<DT><A NAME="12:12">12:12</A><DD>So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as the king had appointed, saying, Come to me again the third day.
<DT><A NAME="12:13">12:13</A><DD>And the king answered the people roughly, and forsook the old men's counsel that they gave him;
<DT><A NAME="12:14">12:14</A><DD>And spake to them after the counsel of the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, and I will add to your yoke: my father <I>also</I> chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.
<DT><A NAME="12:15">12:15</A><DD>Wherefore the king hearkened not unto the people; for the cause was from the LORD, that he might perform his saying, which the LORD spake by Ahijah the Shilonite unto Jeroboam the son of Nebat.
<DT><A NAME="12:16">12:16</A><DD>So when all Israel saw that the king hearkened not unto them, the people answered the king, saying, What portion have we in David? neither <I>have we</I> inheritance in the son of Jesse: to your tents, O Israel: now see to thine own house, David. So Israel departed unto their tents.
<DT><A NAME="12:17">12:17</A><DD>But <I>as for</I> the children of Israel which dwelt in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them.
<DT><A NAME="12:18">12:18</A><DD>Then king Rehoboam sent Adoram, who <I>was</I> over the tribute; and all Israel stoned him with stones, that he died. Therefore king Rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot, to flee to Jerusalem.
<DT><A NAME="12:19">12:19</A><DD>So Israel rebelled against the house of David unto this day.
<DT><A NAME="12:20">12:20</A><DD>And it came to pass, when all Israel heard that Jeroboam was come again, that they sent and called him unto the congregation, and made him king over all Israel: there was none that followed the house of David, but the tribe of Judah only.

<DT><A NAME="12:22">12:22</A><DD>But the word of God came unto Shemaiah the man of God, saying,

<DT><A NAME="12:24">12:24</A><DD>Thus saith the LORD, Ye shall not go up, nor fight against your brethren the children of Israel: return every man to his house; for this thing is from me. They hearkened therefore to the word of the LORD, and returned to depart, according to the word of the LORD.
<DT><A NAME="12:25">12:25</A><DD>Then Jeroboam built Shechem in mount Ephraim, and dwelt therein; and went out from thence, and built Penuel.
<DT><A NAME="12:26">12:26</A><DD>And Jeroboam said in his heart, Now shall the kingdom return to the house of David:

<DT><A NAME="12:28">12:28</A><DD>Whereupon the king took counsel, and made two calves <I>of</I> gold, and said unto them, It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem: behold thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.
<DT><A NAME="12:29">12:29</A><DD>And he set the one in Bethel, and the other put he in Dan.
<DT><A NAME="12:30">12:30</A><DD>And this thing became a sin: for the people went <I>to worship</I> before the one, <I>even</I> unto Dan.
<DT><A NAME="12:31">12:31</A><DD>And he made an house of high places, and made priests of the lowest of the people, which were not of the sons of Levi.
<DT><A NAME="12:32">12:32</A><DD>And Jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month, on the fifteenth day of the month, like unto the feast that <I>is</I> in Judah, and he offered upon the altar.

<DT><A NAME="12:33">12:33</A><DD>So he offered upon the altar which he had made in Bethel the fifteenth day of the eighth month, <I>even</I> in the month which he had devised of his own heart; and ordained a feast unto the children of Israel: and he offered upon the altar, and burnt incense.

<DT><A NAME="13:2">13:2</A><DD>And he cried against the altar in the word of the LORD, and said, O altar, altar, thus saith the LORD; Behold, a child shall be born unto the house of David, Josiah by name; and upon thee shall he offer the priests of the high places that burn incense upon thee, and men's bones shall be burnt upon thee.
<DT><A NAME="13:3">13:3</A><DD>And he gave a sign the same day, saying, This <I>is</I> the sign which the LORD hath spoken; Behold, the altar shall be rent, and the ashes that <I>are</I> upon it shall be poured out.
<DT><A NAME="13:4">13:4</A><DD>And it came to pass, when king Jeroboam heard the saying of the man of God, which had cried against the altar in Bethel, that he put forth his hand from the altar, saying, Lay hold on him.

<DT><A NAME="13:5">13:5</A><DD>The altar also was rent, and the ashes poured out from the altar, according to the sign which the man of God had given by the word of the LORD.
<DT><A NAME="13:6">13:6</A><DD>And the king answered and said unto the man of God, Intreat now the face of the LORD thy God, and pray for me, that my hand may be restored me again. And the man of God besought the LORD, and the king's hand was restored him again, and became as <I>it was</I> before.
<DT><A NAME="13:7">13:7</A><DD>And the king said unto the man of God, Come home with me, and refresh thyself, and I will give thee a reward.

<DT><A NAME="13:11">13:11</A><DD>Now there dwelt an old prophet in Bethel; and his sons came and told him all the works that the man of God had done that day in Bethel: the words which he had spoken unto the king, them they told also to their father.
<DT><A NAME="13:12">13:12</A><DD>And their father said unto them, What way went he? For his sons had seen what way the man of God went, which came from Judah.
<DT><A NAME="13:13">13:13</A><DD>And he said unto his sons, Saddle me the ass. So they saddled him the ass: and he rode thereon,

<DT><A NAME="17:8">17:8</A><DD>And the word of the LORD came unto him, saying,
<DT><A NAME="17:9">17:9</A><DD>Arise, get thee to Zarephath, which <I>belongeth</I> to Zidon, and dwell there: behold, I have commanded a widow woman there to sustain thee.
<DT><A NAME="17:10">17:10</A><DD>So he arose and went to Zarephath. And when he came to the gate of the city, behold, the widow woman <I>was</I> there gathering of sticks: and he called to her, and said, Fetch me, I pray thee, a little water in a vessel, that I may drink.
<DT><A NAME="17:11">17:11</A><DD>And as she was going to fetch <I>it</I>, he called to her, and said, Bring me, I pray thee, a morsel of bread in thine hand.
<DT><A NAME="17:12">17:12</A><DD>And she said, <I>As</I> the LORD thy God liveth, I have not a cake, but an handful of meal in a barrel, and a little oil in a cruse: and, behold, I <I>am</I> gathering two sticks, that I may go in and dress it for me and my son, that we may eat it, and die.
<DT><A NAME="17:13">17:13</A><DD>And Elijah said unto her, Fear not; go <I>and</I> do as thou hast said: but make me thereof a little cake first, and bring <I>it</I> unto me, and after make for thee and for thy son.
<DT><A NAME="17:14">17:14</A><DD>For thus saith the LORD God of Israel, The barrel of meal shall not waste, neither shall the cruse of oil fail, until the day <I>that</I> the LORD sendeth rain upon the earth.
<DT><A NAME="17:15">17:15</A><DD>And she went and did according to the saying of Elijah: and she, and he, and her house, did eat <I>many</I> days.
<DT><A NAME="17:16">17:16</A><DD><I>And</I> the barrel of meal wasted not, neither did the cruse of oil fail, according to the word of the LORD, which he spake by Elijah.
<DT><A NAME="17:17">17:17</A><DD>And it came to pass after these things, <I>that</I> the son of the woman, the mistress of the house, fell sick; and his sickness was so sore, that there was no breath left in him.
<DT><A NAME="17:18">17:18</A><DD>And she said unto Elijah, What have I to do with thee, O thou man of God? art thou come unto me to call my sin to remembrance, and to slay my son?
<DT><A NAME="17:19">17:19</A><DD>And he said unto her, Give me thy son. And he took him out of her bosom, and carried him up into a loft, where he abode, and laid him upon his own bed.
<DT><A NAME="17:20">17:20</A><DD>And he cried unto the LORD, and said, O LORD my God, hast thou also brought evil upon the widow with whom I sojourn, by slaying her son?
<DT><A NAME="17:21">17:21</A><DD>And he stretched himself upon the child three times, and cried unto the LORD, and said, O LORD my God, I pray thee, let this child's soul come into him again.
<DT><A NAME="17:22">17:22</A><DD>And the LORD heard the voice of Elijah; and the soul of the child came into him again, and he revived.
<DT><A NAME="17:23">17:23</A><DD>And Elijah took the child, and brought him down out of the chamber into the house, and delivered him unto his mother: and Elijah said, See, thy son liveth.
<DT><A NAME="17:24">17:24</A><DD>And the woman said to Elijah, Now by this I know that thou <I>art</I> a man of God, <I>and</I> that the word of the LORD in thy mouth <I>is</I> truth.
</DL></DIV><H2>Chapter 18</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="18:1">18:1</A><DD>And it came to pass <I>after</I> many days, that the word of the LORD came to Elijah in the third year, saying, Go, shew thyself unto Ahab; and I will send rain upon the earth.
<DT><A NAME="18:2">18:2</A><DD>And Elijah went to shew himself unto Ahab. And <I>there was</I> a sore famine in Samaria.
<DT><A NAME="18:3">18:3</A><DD>And Ahab called Obadiah, which <I>was</I> the governor of <I>his</I> house. (Now Obadiah feared the LORD greatly:
<DT><A NAME="18:4">18:4</A><DD>For it was <I>so</I>, when Jezebel cut off the prophets of the LORD, that Obadiah took an hundred prophets, and hid them by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water.)
<DT><A NAME="18:5">18:5</A><DD>And Ahab said unto Obadiah, Go into the land, unto all fountains of water, and unto all brooks: peradventure we may find grass to save the horses and mules alive, that we lose not all the beasts.
<DT><A NAME="18:6">18:6</A><DD>So they divided the land between them to pass throughout it: Ahab went one way by himself, and Obadiah went another way by himself.
<DT><A NAME="18:7">18:7</A><DD>And as Obadiah was in the way, behold, Elijah met him: and he knew him, and fell on his face, and said, <I>Art</I> thou that my lord Elijah?
<DT><A NAME="18:8">18:8</A><DD>And he answered him, I <I>am</I>: go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah <I>is here</I>.
<DT><A NAME="18:9">18:9</A><DD>And he said, What have I sinned, that thou wouldest deliver thy servant into the hand of Ahab, to slay me?
<DT><A NAME="18:10">18:10</A><DD><I>As</I> the LORD thy God liveth, there is no nation or kingdom, whither my lord hath not sent to seek thee: and when they said, <I>He is</I> not <I>there</I>; he took an oath of the kingdom and nation, that they found thee not.
<DT><A NAME="18:11">18:11</A><DD>And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah <I>is here</I>.
<DT><A NAME="18:12">18:12</A><DD>And it shall come to pass, <I>as soon as</I> I am gone from thee, that the Spirit of the LORD shall carry thee whither I know not; and <I>so</I> when I come and tell Ahab, and he cannot find thee, he shall slay me: but I thy servant fear the LORD from my youth.
<DT><A NAME="18:13">18:13</A><DD>Was it not told my lord what I did when Jezebel slew the prophets of the LORD, how I hid an hundred men of the LORD'S prophets by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water?
<DT><A NAME="18:14">18:14</A><DD>And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah <I>is here</I>: and he shall slay me.
<DT><A NAME="18:15">18:15</A><DD>And Elijah said, <I>As</I> the LORD of hosts liveth, before whom I stand, I will surely shew myself unto him to day.
<DT><A NAME="18:16">18:16</A><DD>So Obadiah went to meet Ahab, and told him: and Ahab went to meet Elijah.
<DT><A NAME="18:17">18:17</A><DD>And it came to pass, when Ahab saw Elijah, that Ahab said unto him, <I>Art</I> thou he that troubleth Israel?
<DT><A NAME="18:18">18:18</A><DD>And he answered, I have not troubled Israel; but thou, and thy father's house, in that ye have forsaken the commandments of the LORD, and thou hast followed Baalim.
<DT><A NAME="18:19">18:19</A><DD>Now therefore send, <I>and</I> gather to me all Israel unto mount Carmel, and the prophets of Baal four hundred and fifty, and the prophets of the groves four hundred, which eat at Jezebel's table.
<DT><A NAME="18:20">18:20</A><DD>So Ahab sent unto all the children of Israel, and gathered the prophets together unto mount Carmel.
<DT><A NAME="18:21">18:21</A><DD>And Elijah came unto all the people, and said, How long halt ye between two opinions? if the LORD <I>be</I> God, follow him: but if Baal, <I>then</I> follow him. And the people answered him not a word.
<DT><A NAME="18:22">18:22</A><DD>Then said Elijah unto the people, I, <I>even</I> I only, remain a prophet of the LORD; but Baal's prophets <I>are</I> four hundred and fifty men.
<DT><A NAME="18:23">18:23</A><DD>Let them therefore give us two bullocks; and let them choose one bullock for themselves, and cut it in pieces, and lay <I>it</I> on wood, and put no fire <I>under</I>: and I will dress the other bullock, and lay <I>it</I> on wood, and put no fire <I>under</I>:
<DT><A NAME="18:24">18:24</A><DD>And call ye on the name of your gods, and I will call on the name of the LORD: and the God that answereth by fire, let him be God. And all the people answered and said, It is well spoken.
<DT><A NAME="18:25">18:25</A><DD>And Elijah said unto the prophets of Baal, Choose you one bullock for yourselves, and dress <I>it</I> first; for ye <I>are</I> many; and call on the name of your gods, but put no fire <I>under</I>.
<DT><A NAME="18:26">18:26</A><DD>And they took the bullock which was given them, and they dressed <I>it</I>, and called on the name of Baal from morning even until noon, saying, O Baal, hear us. But <I>there was</I> no voice, nor any that answered. And they leaped upon the altar which was made.
<DT><A NAME="18:27">18:27</A><DD>And it came to pass at noon, that Elijah mocked them, and said, Cry aloud: for he <I>is</I> a god; either he is talking, or he is pursuing, or he is in a journey, <I>or</I> peradventure he sleepeth, and must be awaked.
<DT><A NAME="18:28">18:28</A><DD>And they cried aloud, and cut themselves after their manner with knives and lancets, till the blood gushed out upon them.
<DT><A NAME="18:29">18:29</A><DD>And it came to pass, when midday was past, and they prophesied until the <I>time</I> of the offering of the <I>evening</I> sacrifice, that <I>there was</I> neither voice, nor any to answer, nor any that regarded.
<DT><A NAME="18:30">18:30</A><DD>And Elijah said unto all the people, Come near unto me. And all the people came near unto him. And he repaired the altar of the LORD <I>that was</I> broken down.
<DT><A NAME="18:31">18:31</A><DD>And Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, unto whom the word of the LORD came, saying, Israel shall be thy name:
<DT><A NAME="18:32">18:32</A><DD>And with the stones he built an altar in the name of the LORD: and he made a trench about the altar, as great as would contain two measures of seed.
<DT><A NAME="18:33">18:33</A><DD>And he put the wood in order, and cut the bullock in pieces, and laid <I>him</I> on the wood, and said, Fill four barrels with water, and pour <I>it</I> on the burnt sacrifice, and on the wood.
<DT><A NAME="18:34">18:34</A><DD>And he said, Do <I>it</I> the second time. And they did <I>it</I> the second time. And he said, Do <I>it</I> the third time. And they did <I>it</I> the third time.
<DT><A NAME="18:35">18:35</A><DD>And the water ran round about the altar; and he filled the trench also with water.
<DT><A NAME="18:36">18:36</A><DD>And it came to pass at <I>the time of</I> the offering of the <I>evening</I> sacrifice, that Elijah the prophet came near, and said, LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, let it be known this day that thou <I>art</I> God in Israel, and <I>that</I> I <I>am</I> thy servant, and <I>that</I> I have done all these things at thy word.
<DT><A NAME="18:37">18:37</A><DD>Hear me, O LORD, hear me, that this people may know that thou <I>art</I> the LORD God, and <I>that</I> thou hast turned their heart back again.
<DT><A NAME="18:38">18:38</A><DD>Then the fire of the LORD fell, and consumed the burnt sacrifice, and the wood, and the stones, and the dust, and licked up the water that <I>was</I> in the trench.
<DT><A NAME="18:39">18:39</A><DD>And when all the people saw <I>it</I>, they fell on their faces: and they said, The LORD, he <I>is</I> the God; the LORD, he <I>is</I> the God.
<DT><A NAME="18:40">18:40</A><DD>And Elijah said unto them, Take the prophets of Baal; let not one of them escape. And they took them: and Elijah brought them down to the brook Kishon, and slew them there.
<DT><A NAME="18:41">18:41</A><DD>And Elijah said unto Ahab, Get thee up, eat and drink; for <I>there is</I> a sound of abundance of rain.
<DT><A NAME="18:42">18:42</A><DD>So Ahab went up to eat and to drink. And Elijah went up to the top of Carmel; and he cast himself down upon the earth, and put his face between his knees,
<DT><A NAME="18:43">18:43</A><DD>And said to his servant, Go up now, look toward the sea. And he went up, and looked, and said, <I>There is</I> nothing. And he said, Go again seven times.
<DT><A NAME="18:44">18:44</A><DD>And it came to pass at the seventh time, that he said, Behold, there ariseth a little cloud out of the sea, like a man's hand. And he said, Go up, say unto Ahab, Prepare <I>thy chariot</I>, and get thee down, that the rain stop thee not.
<DT><A NAME="18:45">18:45</A><DD>And it came to pass in the mean while, that the heaven was black with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain. And Ahab rode, and went to Jezreel.
<DT><A NAME="18:46">18:46</A><DD>And the hand of the LORD was on Elijah; and he girded up his loins, and ran before Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel.
</DL></DIV><H2>Chapter 19</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="19:1">19:1</A><DD>And Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done, and withal how he had slain all the prophets with the sword.
<DT><A NAME="19:2">19:2</A><DD>Then Jezebel sent a messenger unto Elijah, saying, So let the gods do <I>to me</I>, and more also, if I make not thy life as the life of one of them by to morrow about this time.
<DT><A NAME="19:3">19:3</A><DD>And when he saw <I>that</I>, he arose, and went for his life, and came to Beersheba, which <I>belongeth</I> to Judah, and left his servant there.
<DT><A NAME="19:4">19:4</A><DD>But he himself went a day's journey into the wilderness, and came and sat down under a juniper tree: and he requested for himself that he might die; and said, It is enough; now, O LORD, take away my life; for I <I>am</I> not better than my fathers.
<DT><A NAME="19:5">19:5</A><DD>And as he lay and slept under a juniper tree, behold, then an angel touched him, and said unto him, Arise <I>and</I> eat.
<DT><A NAME="19:6">19:6</A><DD>And he looked, and, behold, <I>there was</I> a cake baken on the coals, and a cruse of water at his head. And he did eat and drink, and laid him down again.
<DT><A NAME="19:7">19:7</A><DD>And the angel of the LORD came again the second time, and touched him, and said, Arise <I>and</I> eat; because the journey <I>is</I> too great for thee.
<DT><A NAME="19:8">19:8</A><DD>And he arose, and did eat and drink, and went in the strength of that meat forty days and forty nights unto Horeb the mount of God.
<DT><A NAME="19:9">19:9</A><DD>And he came thither unto a cave, and lodged there; and, behold, the word of the LORD <I>came</I> to him, and he said unto him, What doest thou here, Elijah?
<DT><A NAME="19:10">19:10</A><DD>And he said, I have been very jealous for the LORD God of hosts: for the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thine altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword; and I, <I>even</I> I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away.
<DT><A NAME="19:11">19:11</A><DD>And he said, Go forth, and stand upon the mount before the LORD. And, behold, the LORD passed by, and a great and strong wind rent the mountains, and brake in pieces the rocks before the LORD; <I>but</I> the LORD <I>was</I> not in the wind: and after the wind an earthquake; <I>but</I> the LORD <I>was</I> not in the earthquake:
<DT><A NAME="19:12">19:12</A><DD>And after the earthquake a fire; <I>but</I> the LORD <I>was</I> not in the fire: and after the fire a still small voice.
<DT><A NAME="19:13">19:13</A><DD>And it was <I>so</I>, when Elijah heard <I>it</I>, that he wrapped his face in his mantle, and went out, and stood in the entering in of the cave. And, behold, <I>there came</I> a voice unto him, and said, What doest thou here, Elijah?
<DT><A NAME="19:14">19:14</A><DD>And he said, I have been very jealous for the LORD God of hosts: because the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thine altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword; and I, <I>even</I> I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away.
<DT><A NAME="19:15">19:15</A><DD>And the LORD said unto him, Go, return on thy way to the wilderness of Damascus: and when thou comest, anoint Hazael <I>to be</I> king over Syria:
<DT><A NAME="19:16">19:16</A><DD>And Jehu the son of Nimshi shalt thou anoint <I>to be</I> king over Israel: and Elisha the son of Shaphat of Abelmeholah shalt thou anoint <I>to be</I> prophet in thy room.
<DT><A NAME="19:17">19:17</A><DD>And it shall come to pass, <I>that</I> him that escapeth the sword of Hazael shall Jehu slay: and him that escapeth from the sword of Jehu shall Elisha slay.
<DT><A NAME="19:18">19:18</A><DD>Yet I have left <I>me</I> seven thousand in Israel, all the knees which have not bowed unto Baal, and every mouth which hath not kissed him.
<DT><A NAME="19:19">19:19</A><DD>So he departed thence, and found Elisha the son of Shaphat, who <I>was</I> plowing <I>with</I> twelve yoke <I>of oxen</I> before him, and he with the twelfth: and Elijah passed by him, and cast his mantle upon him.
<DT><A NAME="19:20">19:20</A><DD>And he left the oxen, and ran after Elijah, and said, Let me, I pray thee, kiss my father and my mother, and <I>then</I> I will follow thee. And he said unto him, Go back again: for what have I done to thee?
<DT><A NAME="19:21">19:21</A><DD>And he returned back from him, and took a yoke of oxen, and slew them, and boiled their flesh with the instruments of the oxen, and gave unto the people, and they did eat. Then he arose, and went after Elijah, and ministered unto him.

<DT><A NAME="20:29">20:29</A><DD>And they pitched one over against the other seven days. And <I>so</I> it was, that in the seventh day the battle was joined: and the children of Israel slew of the Syrians an hundred thousand footmen in one day.
<DT><A NAME="20:30">20:30</A><DD>But the rest fled to Aphek, into the city; and <I>there</I> a wall fell upon twenty and seven thousand of the men <I>that were</I> left. And Benhadad fled, and came into the city, into an inner chamber.
<DT><A NAME="20:31">20:31</A><DD>And his servants said unto him, Behold now, we have heard that the kings of the house of Israel <I>are</I> merciful kings: let us, I pray thee, put sackcloth on our loins, and ropes upon our heads, and go out to the king of Israel: peradventure he will save thy life.
<DT><A NAME="20:32">20:32</A><DD>So they girded sackcloth on their loins, and <I>put</I> ropes on their heads, and came to the king of Israel, and said, Thy servant Benhadad saith, I pray thee, let me live. And he said, <I>Is</I> he yet alive? he <I>is</I> my brother.
<DT><A NAME="20:33">20:33</A><DD>Now the men did diligently observe whether <I>any thing would come</I> from him, and did hastily catch <I>it</I>: and they said, Thy brother Benhadad. Then he said, Go ye, bring him. Then Benhadad came forth to him; and he caused him to come up into the chariot.
<DT><A NAME="20:34">20:34</A><DD>And <I>Benhadad</I> said unto him, The cities, which my father took from thy father, I will restore; and thou shalt make streets for thee in Damascus, as my father made in Samaria. Then <I>said Ahab</I>, I will send thee away with this covenant. So he made a covenant with him, and sent him away.
<DT><A NAME="20:35">20:35</A><DD>And a certain man of the sons of the prophets said unto his neighbour in the word of the LORD, Smite me, I pray thee. And the man refused to smite him.
<DT><A NAME="20:36">20:36</A><DD>Then said he unto him, Because thou hast not obeyed the voice of the LORD, behold, as soon as thou art departed from me, a lion shall slay thee. And as soon as he was departed from him, a lion found him, and slew him.
<DT><A NAME="20:37">20:37</A><DD>Then he found another man, and said, Smite me, I pray thee. And the man smote him, so that in smiting he wounded <I>him</I>.
<DT><A NAME="20:38">20:38</A><DD>So the prophet departed, and waited for the king by the way, and disguised himself with ashes upon his face.
<DT><A NAME="20:39">20:39</A><DD>And as the king passed by, he cried unto the king: and he said, Thy servant went out into the midst of the battle; and, behold, a man turned aside, and brought a man unto me, and said, Keep this man: if by any means he be missing, then shall thy life be for his life, or else thou shalt pay a talent of silver.
<DT><A NAME="20:40">20:40</A><DD>And as thy servant was busy here and there, he was gone. And the king of Israel said unto him, So <I>shall</I> thy judgment <I>be</I>; thyself hast decided <I>it</I>.
<DT><A NAME="20:41">20:41</A><DD>And he hasted, and took the ashes away from his face; and the king of Israel discerned him that he <I>was</I> of the prophets.
<DT><A NAME="20:42">20:42</A><DD>And he said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Because thou hast let go out of <I>thy</I> hand a man whom I appointed to utter destruction, therefore thy life shall go for his life, and thy people for his people.
<DT><A NAME="20:43">20:43</A><DD>And the king of Israel went to his house heavy and displeased, and came to Samaria.
</DL></DIV><H2>Chapter 21</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="21:1">21:1</A><DD>And it came to pass after these things, <I>that</I> Naboth the Jezreelite had a vineyard, which <I>was</I> in Jezreel, hard by the palace of Ahab king of Samaria.
<DT><A NAME="21:2">21:2</A><DD>And Ahab spake unto Naboth, saying, Give me thy vineyard, that I may have it for a garden of herbs, because it <I>is</I> near unto my house: and I will give thee for it a better vineyard than it; <I>or</I>, if it seem good to thee, I will give thee the worth of it in money.
<DT><A NAME="21:3">21:3</A><DD>And Naboth said to Ahab, The LORD forbid it me, that I should give the inheritance of my fathers unto thee.
<DT><A NAME="21:4">21:4</A><DD>And Ahab came into his house heavy and displeased because of the word which Naboth the Jezreelite had spoken to him: for he had said, I will not give thee the inheritance of my fathers. And he laid him down upon his bed, and turned away his face, and would eat no bread.
<DT><A NAME="21:5">21:5</A><DD>But Jezebel his wife came to him, and said unto him, Why is thy spirit so sad, that thou eatest no bread?
<DT><A NAME="21:6">21:6</A><DD>And he said unto her, Because I spake unto Naboth the Jezreelite, and said unto him, Give me thy vineyard for money; or else, if it please thee, I will give thee <I>another</I> vineyard for it: and he answered, I will not give thee my vineyard.
<DT><A NAME="21:7">21:7</A><DD>And Jezebel his wife said unto him, Dost thou now govern the kingdom of Israel? arise, <I>and</I> eat bread, and let thine heart be merry: I will give thee the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.
<DT><A NAME="21:8">21:8</A><DD>So she wrote letters in Ahab's name, and sealed <I>them</I> with his seal, and sent the letters unto the elders and to the nobles that <I>were</I> in his city, dwelling with Naboth.
<DT><A NAME="21:9">21:9</A><DD>And she wrote in the letters, saying, Proclaim a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people:
<DT><A NAME="21:10">21:10</A><DD>And set two men, sons of Belial, before him, to bear witness against him, saying, Thou didst blaspheme God and the king. And <I>then</I> carry him out, and stone him, that he may die.
<DT><A NAME="21:11">21:11</A><DD>And the men of his city, <I>even</I> the elders and the nobles who were the inhabitants in his city, did as Jezebel had sent unto them, <I>and</I> as it <I>was</I> written in the letters which she had sent unto them.
<DT><A NAME="21:12">21:12</A><DD>They proclaimed a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people.
<DT><A NAME="21:13">21:13</A><DD>And there came in two men, children of Belial, and sat before him: and the men of Belial witnessed against him, <I>even</I> against Naboth, in the presence of the people, saying, Naboth did blaspheme God and the king. Then they carried him forth out of the city, and stoned him with stones, that he died.
<DT><A NAME="21:14">21:14</A><DD>Then they sent to Jezebel, saying, Naboth is stoned, and is dead.
<DT><A NAME="21:15">21:15</A><DD>And it came to pass, when Jezebel heard that Naboth was stoned, and was dead, that Jezebel said to Ahab, Arise, take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, which he refused to give thee for money: for Naboth is not alive, but dead.
<DT><A NAME="21:16">21:16</A><DD>And it came to pass, when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, that Ahab rose up to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, to take possession of it.
<DT><A NAME="21:17">21:17</A><DD>And the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,
<DT><A NAME="21:18">21:18</A><DD>Arise, go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, which <I>is</I> in Samaria: behold, <I>he is</I> in the vineyard of Naboth, whither he is gone down to possess it.
<DT><A NAME="21:19">21:19</A><DD>And thou shalt speak unto him, saying, Thus saith the LORD, Hast thou killed, and also taken possession? And thou shalt speak unto him, saying, Thus saith the LORD, In the place where dogs licked the blood of Naboth shall dogs lick thy blood, even thine.
<DT><A NAME="21:20">21:20</A><DD>And Ahab said to Elijah, Hast thou found me, O mine enemy? And he answered, I have found <I>thee</I>: because thou hast sold thyself to work evil in the sight of the LORD.
<DT><A NAME="21:21">21:21</A><DD>Behold, I will bring evil upon thee, and will take away thy posterity, and will cut off from Ahab him that pisseth against the wall, and him that is shut up and left in Israel,
<DT><A NAME="21:22">21:22</A><DD>And will make thine house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah, for the provocation wherewith thou hast provoked <I>me</I> to anger, and made Israel to sin.
<DT><A NAME="21:23">21:23</A><DD>And of Jezebel also spake the LORD, saying, The dogs shall eat Jezebel by the wall of Jezreel.
<DT><A NAME="21:24">21:24</A><DD>Him that dieth of Ahab in the city the dogs shall eat; and him that dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat.
<DT><A NAME="21:25">21:25</A><DD>But there was none like unto Ahab, which did sell himself to work wickedness in the sight of the LORD, whom Jezebel his wife stirred up.
<DT><A NAME="21:26">21:26</A><DD>And he did very abominably in following idols, according to all <I>things</I> as did the Amorites, whom the LORD cast out before the children of Israel.
<DT><A NAME="21:27">21:27</A><DD>And it came to pass, when Ahab heard those words, that he rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his flesh, and fasted, and lay in sackcloth, and went softly.
<DT><A NAME="21:28">21:28</A><DD>And the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,
<DT><A NAME="21:29">21:29</A><DD>Seest thou how Ahab humbleth himself before me? because he humbleth himself before me, I will not bring the evil in his days: <I>but</I> in his son's days will I bring the evil upon his house.
</DL></DIV><H2>Chapter 22</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="22:1">22:1</A><DD>And they continued three years without war between Syria and Israel.
<DT><A NAME="22:2">22:2</A><DD>And it came to pass in the third year, that Jehoshaphat the king of Judah came down to the king of Israel.
<DT><A NAME="22:3">22:3</A><DD>And the king of Israel said unto his servants, Know ye that Ramoth in Gilead <I>is</I> ours, and we <I>be</I> still, <I>and</I> take it not out of the hand of the king of Syria?
<DT><A NAME="22:4">22:4</A><DD>And he said unto Jehoshaphat, Wilt thou go with me to battle to Ramothgilead? And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, I <I>am</I> as thou <I>art</I>, my people as thy people, my horses as thy horses.
<DT><A NAME="22:5">22:5</A><DD>And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel, Enquire, I pray thee, at the word of the LORD to day.
<DT><A NAME="22:6">22:6</A><DD>Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, about four hundred men, and said unto them, Shall I go against Ramothgilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up; for the Lord shall deliver <I>it</I> into the hand of the king.
<DT><A NAME="22:7">22:7</A><DD>And Jehoshaphat said, <I>Is there</I> not here a prophet of the LORD besides, that we might enquire of him?
<DT><A NAME="22:8">22:8</A><DD>And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, <I>There is</I> yet one man, Micaiah the son of Imlah, by whom we may enquire of the LORD: but I hate him; for he doth not prophesy good concerning me, but evil. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king say so.
<DT><A NAME="22:9">22:9</A><DD>Then the king of Israel called an officer, and said, Hasten <I>hither</I> Micaiah the son of Imlah.
<DT><A NAME="22:10">22:10</A><DD>And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah sat each on his throne, having put on their robes, in a void place in the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets prophesied before them.
<DT><A NAME="22:11">22:11</A><DD>And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made him horns of iron: and he said, Thus saith the LORD, With these shalt thou push the Syrians, until thou have consumed them.
<DT><A NAME="22:12">22:12</A><DD>And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramothgilead, and prosper: for the LORD shall deliver <I>it</I> into the king's hand.
<DT><A NAME="22:13">22:13</A><DD>And the messenger that was gone to call Micaiah spake unto him, saying, Behold now, the words of the prophets <I>declare</I> good unto the king with one mouth: let thy word, I pray thee, be like the word of one of them, and speak <I>that which is</I> good.
<DT><A NAME="22:14">22:14</A><DD>And Micaiah said, <I>As</I> the LORD liveth, what the LORD saith unto me, that will I speak.
<DT><A NAME="22:15">22:15</A><DD>So he came to the king. And the king said unto him, Micaiah, shall we go against Ramothgilead to battle, or shall we forbear? And he answered him, Go, and prosper: for the LORD shall deliver <I>it</I> into the hand of the king.
<DT><A NAME="22:16">22:16</A><DD>And the king said unto him, How many times shall I adjure thee that thou tell me nothing but <I>that which is</I> true in the name of the LORD?
<DT><A NAME="22:17">22:17</A><DD>And he said, I saw all Israel scattered upon the hills, as sheep that have not a shepherd: and the LORD said, These have no master: let them return every man to his house in peace.
<DT><A NAME="22:18">22:18</A><DD>And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell thee that he would prophesy no good concerning me, but evil?
<DT><A NAME="22:19">22:19</A><DD>And he said, Hear thou therefore the word of the LORD: I saw the LORD sitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven standing by him on his right hand and on his left.
<DT><A NAME="22:20">22:20</A><DD>And the LORD said, Who shall persuade Ahab, that he may go up and fall at Ramothgilead? And one said on this manner, and another said on that manner.
<DT><A NAME="22:21">22:21</A><DD>And there came forth a spirit, and stood before the LORD, and said, I will persuade him.
<DT><A NAME="22:22">22:22</A><DD>And the LORD said unto him, Wherewith? And he said, I will go forth, and I will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And he said, Thou shalt persuade <I>him</I>, and prevail also: go forth, and do so.
<DT><A NAME="22:23">22:23</A><DD>Now therefore, behold, the LORD hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these thy prophets, and the LORD hath spoken evil concerning thee.
<DT><A NAME="22:24">22:24</A><DD>But Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah went near, and smote Micaiah on the cheek, and said, Which way went the Spirit of the LORD from me to speak unto thee?
<DT><A NAME="22:25">22:25</A><DD>And Micaiah said, Behold, thou shalt see in that day, when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself.
<DT><A NAME="22:26">22:26</A><DD>And the king of Israel said, Take Micaiah, and carry him back unto Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king's son;
<DT><A NAME="22:27">22:27</A><DD>And say, Thus saith the king, Put this <I>fellow</I> in the prison, and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction, until I come in peace.
<DT><A NAME="22:28">22:28</A><DD>And Micaiah said, If thou return at all in peace, the LORD hath not spoken by me. And he said, Hearken, O people, every one of you.
<DT><A NAME="22:29">22:29</A><DD>So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramothgilead.
<DT><A NAME="22:30">22:30</A><DD>And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself, and enter into the battle; but put thou on thy robes. And the king of Israel disguised himself, and went into the battle.
<DT><A NAME="22:31">22:31</A><DD>But the king of Syria commanded his thirty and two captains that had rule over his chariots, saying, Fight neither with small nor great, save only with the king of Israel.
<DT><A NAME="22:32">22:32</A><DD>And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, Surely it <I>is</I> the king of Israel. And they turned aside to fight against him: and Jehoshaphat cried out.
<DT><A NAME="22:33">22:33</A><DD>And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots perceived that it <I>was</I> not the king of Israel, that they turned back from pursuing him.
<DT><A NAME="22:34">22:34</A><DD>And a <I>certain</I> man drew a bow at a venture, and smote the king of Israel between the joints of the harness: wherefore he said unto the driver of his chariot, Turn thine hand, and carry me out of the host; for I am wounded.
<DT><A NAME="22:35">22:35</A><DD>And the battle increased that day: and the king was stayed up in his chariot against the Syrians, and died at even: and the blood ran out of the wound into the midst of the chariot.
<DT><A NAME="22:36">22:36</A><DD>And there went a proclamation throughout the host about the going down of the sun, saying, Every man to his city, and every man to his own country.
<DT><A NAME="22:37">22:37</A><DD>So the king died, and was brought to Samaria; and they buried the king in Samaria.
<DT><A NAME="22:38">22:38</A><DD>And <I>one</I> washed the chariot in the pool of Samaria; and the dogs licked up his blood; and they washed his armour; according unto the word of the LORD which he spake.
<DT><A NAME="22:39">22:39</A><DD>Now the rest of the acts of Ahab, and all that he did, and the ivory house which he made, and all the cities that he built, <I>are</I> they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
<DT><A NAME="22:40">22:40</A><DD>So Ahab slept with his fathers; and Ahaziah his son reigned in his stead.
<DT><A NAME="22:41">22:41</A><DD>And Jehoshaphat the son of Asa began to reign over Judah in the fourth year of Ahab king of Israel.
<DT><A NAME="22:42">22:42</A><DD>Jehoshaphat <I>was</I> thirty and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty and five years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name <I>was</I> Azubah the daughter of Shilhi.
<DT><A NAME="22:43">22:43</A><DD>And he walked in all the ways of Asa his father; he turned not aside from it, doing <I>that which was</I> right in the eyes of the LORD: nevertheless the high places were not taken away; <I>for</I> the people offered and burnt incense yet in the high places.
<DT><A NAME="22:44">22:44</A><DD>And Jehoshaphat made peace with the king of Israel.
<DT><A NAME="22:45">22:45</A><DD>Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, and his might that he shewed, and how he warred, <I>are</I> they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
<DT><A NAME="22:46">22:46</A><DD>And the remnant of the sodomites, which remained in the days of his father Asa, he took out of the land.
<DT><A NAME="22:47">22:47</A><DD><I>There was</I> then no king in Edom: a deputy <I>was</I> king.
<DT><A NAME="22:48">22:48</A><DD>Jehoshaphat made ships of Tharshish to go to Ophir for gold: but they went not; for the ships were broken at Eziongeber.
<DT><A NAME="22:49">22:49</A><DD>Then said Ahaziah the son of Ahab unto Jehoshaphat, Let my servants go with thy servants in the ships. But Jehoshaphat would not.
<DT><A NAME="22:50">22:50</A><DD>And Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father: and Jehoram his son reigned in his stead.
<DT><A NAME="22:51">22:51</A><DD>Ahaziah the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned two years over Israel.
<DT><A NAME="22:52">22:52</A><DD>And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the way of his father, and in the way of his mother, and in the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin:
<DT><A NAME="22:53">22:53</A><DD>For he served Baal, and worshipped him, and provoked to anger the LORD God of Israel, according to all that his father had done.
