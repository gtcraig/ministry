<H2>Chapter 1</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="1:1">1:1</A><DD>Paul, called <I>to be</I> an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, and Sosthenes <I>our</I> brother,
<DT><A NAME="1:2">1:2</A><DD>Unto the church of God which is at Corinth, to them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called <I>to be</I> saints, with all that in every place call upon the name of Jesus Christ our Lord, both theirs and ours:
<DT><A NAME="1:3">1:3</A><DD>Grace <I>be</I> unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and <I>from</I> the Lord Jesus Christ.
<DT><A NAME="1:4">1:4</A><DD>I thank my God always on your behalf, for the grace of God which is given you by Jesus Christ;
<DT><A NAME="1:5">1:5</A><DD>That in every thing ye are enriched by him, in all utterance, and <I>in</I> all knowledge;
<DT><A NAME="1:6">1:6</A><DD>Even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you:
<DT><A NAME="1:7">1:7</A><DD>So that ye come behind in no gift; waiting for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ:
<DT><A NAME="1:8">1:8</A><DD>Who shall also confirm you unto the end, <I>that ye may be</I> blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.
<DT><A NAME="1:9">1:9</A><DD>God <I>is</I> faithful, by whom ye were called unto the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord.
<DT><A NAME="1:10">1:10</A><DD>Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all speak the same thing, and <I>that</I> there be no divisions among you; but <I>that</I> ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment.
<DT><A NAME="1:11">1:11</A><DD>For it hath been declared unto me of you, my brethren, by them <I>which are of the house</I> of Chloe, that there are contentions among you.
<DT><A NAME="1:12">1:12</A><DD>Now this I say, that every one of you saith, I am of Paul; and I of Apollos; and I of Cephas; and I of Christ.
<DT><A NAME="1:13">1:13</A><DD>Is Christ divided? was Paul crucified for you? or were ye baptized in the name of Paul?
<DT><A NAME="1:14">1:14</A><DD>I thank God that I baptized none of you, but Crispus and Gaius;
<DT><A NAME="1:15">1:15</A><DD>Lest any should say that I had baptized in mine own name.
<DT><A NAME="1:16">1:16</A><DD>And I baptized also the household of Stephanas: besides, I know not whether I baptized any other.
<DT><A NAME="1:17">1:17</A><DD>For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel: not with wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made of none effect.
<DT><A NAME="1:18">1:18</A><DD>For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness; but unto us which are saved it is the power of God.
<DT><A NAME="1:19">1:19</A><DD>For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent.
<DT><A NAME="1:20">1:20</A><DD>Where <I>is</I> the wise? where <I>is</I> the scribe? where <I>is</I> the disputer of this world? hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?
<DT><A NAME="1:21">1:21</A><DD>For after that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe.
<DT><A NAME="1:22">1:22</A><DD>For the Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seek after wisdom:
<DT><A NAME="1:23">1:23</A><DD>But we preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews a stumblingblock, and unto the Greeks foolishness;
<DT><A NAME="1:24">1:24</A><DD>But unto them which are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God.
<DT><A NAME="1:25">1:25</A><DD>Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the weakness of God is stronger than men.
<DT><A NAME="1:26">1:26</A><DD>For ye see your calling, brethren, how that not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, <I>are called</I>:
<DT><A NAME="1:27">1:27</A><DD>But God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty;
<DT><A NAME="1:28">1:28</A><DD>And base things of the world, and things which are despised, hath God chosen, <I>yea</I>, and things which are not, to bring to nought things that are:
<DT><A NAME="1:29">1:29</A><DD>That no flesh should glory in his presence.
<DT><A NAME="1:30">1:30</A><DD>But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption:
<DT><A NAME="1:31">1:31</A><DD>That, according as it is written, He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.
</DL></DIV><H2>Chapter 2</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="2:1">2:1</A><DD>And I, brethren, when I came to you, came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom, declaring unto you the testimony of God.
<DT><A NAME="2:2">2:2</A><DD>For I determined not to know any thing among you, save Jesus Christ, and him crucified.
<DT><A NAME="2:3">2:3</A><DD>And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling.
<DT><A NAME="2:4">2:4</A><DD>And my speech and my preaching <I>was</I> not with enticing words of man's wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power:
<DT><A NAME="2:5">2:5</A><DD>That your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.
<DT><A NAME="2:6">2:6</A><DD>Howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect: yet not the wisdom of this world, nor of the princes of this world, that come to nought:
<DT><A NAME="2:7">2:7</A><DD>But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, <I>even</I> the hidden <I>wisdom</I>, which God ordained before the world unto our glory:
<DT><A NAME="2:8">2:8</A><DD>Which none of the princes of this world knew: for had they known <I>it</I>, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.
<DT><A NAME="2:9">2:9</A><DD>But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.
<DT><A NAME="2:10">2:10</A><DD>But God hath revealed <I>them</I> unto us by his Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God.
<DT><A NAME="2:11">2:11</A><DD>For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him? even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God.
<DT><A NAME="2:12">2:12</A><DD>Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God.
<DT><A NAME="2:13">2:13</A><DD>Which things also we speak, not in the words which man's wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing spiritual things with spiritual.
<DT><A NAME="2:14">2:14</A><DD>But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know <I>them</I>, because they are spiritually discerned.
<DT><A NAME="2:15">2:15</A><DD>But he that is spiritual judgeth all things, yet he himself is judged of no man.
<DT><A NAME="2:16">2:16</A><DD>For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ.
</DL></DIV><H2>Chapter 3</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="3:1">3:1</A><DD>And I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, <I>even</I> as unto babes in Christ.
<DT><A NAME="3:2">3:2</A><DD>I have fed you with milk, and not with meat: for hitherto ye were not able <I>to bear it</I>, neither yet now are ye able.
<DT><A NAME="3:3">3:3</A><DD>For ye are yet carnal: for whereas <I>there is</I> among you envying, and strife, and divisions, are ye not carnal, and walk as men?
<DT><A NAME="3:4">3:4</A><DD>For while one saith, I am of Paul; and another, I <I>am</I> of Apollos; are ye not carnal?
<DT><A NAME="3:5">3:5</A><DD>Who then is Paul, and who <I>is</I> Apollos, but ministers by whom ye believed, even as the Lord gave to every man?
<DT><A NAME="3:6">3:6</A><DD>I have planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase.
<DT><A NAME="3:7">3:7</A><DD>So then neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he that watereth; but God that giveth the increase.
<DT><A NAME="3:8">3:8</A><DD>Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one: and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labour.
<DT><A NAME="3:9">3:9</A><DD>For we are labourers together with God: ye are God's husbandry, <I>ye are</I> God's building.
<DT><A NAME="3:10">3:10</A><DD>According to the grace of God which is given unto me, as a wise masterbuilder, I have laid the foundation, and another buildeth thereon. But let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon.
<DT><A NAME="3:11">3:11</A><DD>For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ.
<DT><A NAME="3:12">3:12</A><DD>Now if any man build upon this foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble;
<DT><A NAME="3:13">3:13</A><DD>Every man's work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is.
<DT><A NAME="3:14">3:14</A><DD>If any man's work abide which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive a reward.
<DT><A NAME="3:15">3:15</A><DD>If any man's work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as by fire.
<DT><A NAME="3:16">3:16</A><DD>Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and <I>that</I> the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?
<DT><A NAME="3:17">3:17</A><DD>If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which <I>temple</I> ye are.
<DT><A NAME="3:18">3:18</A><DD>Let no man deceive himself. If any man among you seemeth to be wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be wise.
<DT><A NAME="3:19">3:19</A><DD>For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, He taketh the wise in their own craftiness.
<DT><A NAME="3:20">3:20</A><DD>And again, The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain.
<DT><A NAME="3:21">3:21</A><DD>Therefore let no man glory in men. For all things are yours;
<DT><A NAME="3:22">3:22</A><DD>Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours;
<DT><A NAME="3:23">3:23</A><DD>And ye are Christ's; and Christ <I>is</I> God's.
</DL></DIV><H2>Chapter 4</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="4:1">4:1</A><DD>Let a man so account of us, as of the ministers of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God.
<DT><A NAME="4:2">4:2</A><DD>Moreover it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful.
<DT><A NAME="4:3">4:3</A><DD>But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged of you, or of man's judgment: yea, I judge not mine own self.
<DT><A NAME="4:4">4:4</A><DD>For I know nothing by myself; yet am I not hereby justified: but he that judgeth me is the Lord.
<DT><A NAME="4:5">4:5</A><DD>Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts: and then shall every man have praise of God.
<DT><A NAME="4:6">4:6</A><DD>And these things, brethren, I have in a figure transferred to myself and <I>to</I> Apollos for your sakes; that ye might learn in us not to think <I>of men</I> above that which is written, that no one of you be puffed up for one against another.
<DT><A NAME="4:7">4:7</A><DD>For who maketh thee to differ <I>from another</I>? and what hast thou that thou didst not receive? now if thou didst receive <I>it</I>, why dost thou glory, as if thou hadst not received <I>it</I>?
<DT><A NAME="4:8">4:8</A><DD>Now ye are full, now ye are rich, ye have reigned as kings without us: and I would to God ye did reign, that we also might reign with you.
<DT><A NAME="4:9">4:9</A><DD>For I think that God hath set forth us the apostles last, as it were appointed to death: for we are made a spectacle unto the world, and to angels, and to men.
<DT><A NAME="4:10">4:10</A><DD>We <I>are</I> fools for Christ's sake, but ye <I>are</I> wise in Christ; we <I>are</I> weak, but ye <I>are</I> strong; ye <I>are</I> honourable, but we <I>are</I> despised.
<DT><A NAME="4:11">4:11</A><DD>Even unto this present hour we both hunger, and thirst, and are naked, and are buffeted, and have no certain dwellingplace;
<DT><A NAME="4:12">4:12</A><DD>And labour, working with our own hands: being reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we suffer it:
<DT><A NAME="4:13">4:13</A><DD>Being defamed, we intreat: we are made as the filth of the world, <I>and are</I> the offscouring of all things unto this day.
<DT><A NAME="4:14">4:14</A><DD>I write not these things to shame you, but as my beloved sons I warn <I>you</I>.
<DT><A NAME="4:15">4:15</A><DD>For though ye have ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet <I>have ye</I> not many fathers: for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel.
<DT><A NAME="4:16">4:16</A><DD>Wherefore I beseech you, be ye followers of me.
<DT><A NAME="4:17">4:17</A><DD>For this cause have I sent unto you Timotheus, who is my beloved son, and faithful in the Lord, who shall bring you into remembrance of my ways which be in Christ, as I teach every where in every church.
<DT><A NAME="4:18">4:18</A><DD>Now some are puffed up, as though I would not come to you.
<DT><A NAME="4:19">4:19</A><DD>But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord will, and will know, not the speech of them which are puffed up, but the power.
<DT><A NAME="4:20">4:20</A><DD>For the kingdom of God <I>is</I> not in word, but in power.
<DT><A NAME="4:21">4:21</A><DD>What will ye? shall I come unto you with a rod, or in love, and <I>in</I> the spirit of meekness?
</DL></DIV><H2>Chapter 5</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="5:1">5:1</A><DD>It is reported commonly <I>that there is</I> fornication among you, and such fornication as is not so much as named among the Gentiles, that one should have his father's wife.
<DT><A NAME="5:2">5:2</A><DD>And ye are puffed up, and have not rather mourned, that he that hath done this deed might be taken away from among you.
<DT><A NAME="5:3">5:3</A><DD>For I verily, as absent in body, but present in spirit, have judged already, as though I were present, <I>concerning</I> him that hath so done this deed,
<DT><A NAME="5:4">5:4</A><DD>In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when ye are gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ,
<DT><A NAME="5:5">5:5</A><DD>To deliver such an one unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.
<DT><A NAME="5:6">5:6</A><DD>Your glorying <I>is</I> not good. Know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump?
<DT><A NAME="5:7">5:7</A><DD>Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, as ye are unleavened. For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us:
<DT><A NAME="5:8">5:8</A><DD>Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness; but with the unleavened <I>bread</I> of sincerity and truth.
<DT><A NAME="5:9">5:9</A><DD>I wrote unto you in an epistle not to company with fornicators:
<DT><A NAME="5:10">5:10</A><DD>Yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous, or extortioners, or with idolaters; for then must ye needs go out of the world.
<DT><A NAME="5:11">5:11</A><DD>But now I have written unto you not to keep company, if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner; with such an one no not to eat.
<DT><A NAME="5:12">5:12</A><DD>For what have I to do to judge them also that are without? do not ye judge them that are within?
<DT><A NAME="5:13">5:13</A><DD>But them that are without God judgeth. Therefore put away from among yourselves that wicked person.
</DL></DIV><H2>Chapter 6</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="6:1">6:1</A><DD>Dare any of you, having a matter against another, go to law before the unjust, and not before the saints?
<DT><A NAME="6:2">6:2</A><DD>Do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world? and if the world shall be judged by you, are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters?
<DT><A NAME="6:3">6:3</A><DD>Know ye not that we shall judge angels? how much more things that pertain to this life?
<DT><A NAME="6:4">6:4</A><DD>If then ye have judgments of things pertaining to this life, set them to judge who are least esteemed in the church.
<DT><A NAME="6:5">6:5</A><DD>I speak to your shame. Is it so, that there is not a wise man among you? no, not one that shall be able to judge between his brethren?
<DT><A NAME="6:6">6:6</A><DD>But brother goeth to law with brother, and that before the unbelievers.
<DT><A NAME="6:7">6:7</A><DD>Now therefore there is utterly a fault among you, because ye go to law one with another. Why do ye not rather take wrong? why do ye not rather <I>suffer yourselves to</I> be defrauded?
<DT><A NAME="6:8">6:8</A><DD>Nay, ye do wrong, and defraud, and that <I>your</I> brethren.
<DT><A NAME="6:9">6:9</A><DD>Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind,
<DT><A NAME="6:10">6:10</A><DD>Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.
<DT><A NAME="6:11">6:11</A><DD>And such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.
<DT><A NAME="6:12">6:12</A><DD>All things are lawful unto me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the power of any.
<DT><A NAME="6:13">6:13</A><DD>Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats: but God shall destroy both it and them. Now the body <I>is</I> not for fornication, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body.
<DT><A NAME="6:14">6:14</A><DD>And God hath both raised up the Lord, and will also raise up us by his own power.
<DT><A NAME="6:15">6:15</A><DD>Know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ? shall I then take the members of Christ, and make <I>them</I> the members of an harlot? God forbid.
<DT><A NAME="6:16">6:16</A><DD>What? know ye not that he which is joined to an harlot is one body? for two, saith he, shall be one flesh.
<DT><A NAME="6:17">6:17</A><DD>But he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit.
<DT><A NAME="6:18">6:18</A><DD>Flee fornication. Every sin that a man doeth is without the body; but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body.
<DT><A NAME="6:19">6:19</A><DD>What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost <I>which is</I> in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own?
<DT><A NAME="6:20">6:20</A><DD>For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's.
</DL></DIV><H2>Chapter 7</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="7:1">7:1</A><DD>Now concerning the things whereof ye wrote unto me: <I>It is</I> good for a man not to touch a woman.

<DT><A NAME="7:3">7:3</A><DD>Let the husband render unto the wife due benevolence: and likewise also the wife unto the husband.
<DT><A NAME="7:4">7:4</A><DD>The wife hath not power of her own body, but the husband: and likewise also the husband hath not power of his own body, but the wife.
<DT><A NAME="7:5">7:5</A><DD>Defraud ye not one the other, except <I>it be</I> with consent for a time, that ye may give yourselves to fasting and prayer; and come together again, that Satan tempt you not for your incontinency.
<DT><A NAME="7:6">7:6</A><DD>But I speak this by permission, <I>and</I> not of commandment.
<DT><A NAME="7:7">7:7</A><DD>For I would that all men were even as I myself. But every man hath his proper gift of God, one after this manner, and another after that.
<DT><A NAME="7:8">7:8</A><DD>I say therefore to the unmarried and widows, It is good for them if they abide even as I.
<DT><A NAME="7:9">7:9</A><DD>But if they cannot contain, let them marry: for it is better to marry than to burn.
<DT><A NAME="7:10">7:10</A><DD>And unto the married I command, <I>yet</I> not I, but the Lord, Let not the wife depart from <I>her</I> husband:
<DT><A NAME="7:11">7:11</A><DD>But and if she depart, let her remain unmarried, or be reconciled to <I>her</I> husband: and let not the husband put away <I>his</I> wife.
<DT><A NAME="7:12">7:12</A><DD>But to the rest speak I, not the Lord: If any brother hath a wife that believeth not, and she be pleased to dwell with him, let him not put her away.
<DT><A NAME="7:13">7:13</A><DD>And the woman which hath an husband that believeth not, and if he be pleased to dwell with her, let her not leave him.
<DT><A NAME="7:14">7:14</A><DD>For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband: else were your children unclean; but now are they holy.
<DT><A NAME="7:15">7:15</A><DD>But if the unbelieving depart, let him depart. A brother or a sister is not under bondage in such <I>cases</I>: but God hath called us to peace.
<DT><A NAME="7:16">7:16</A><DD>For what knowest thou, O wife, whether thou shalt save <I>thy</I> husband? or how knowest thou, O man, whether thou shalt save <I>thy</I> wife?
<DT><A NAME="7:17">7:17</A><DD>But as God hath distributed to every man, as the Lord hath called every one, so let him walk. And so ordain I in all churches.
<DT><A NAME="7:18">7:18</A><DD>Is any man called being circumcised? let him not become uncircumcised. Is any called in uncircumcision? let him not be circumcised.
<DT><A NAME="7:19">7:19</A><DD>Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God.
<DT><A NAME="7:20">7:20</A><DD>Let every man abide in the same calling wherein he was called.
<DT><A NAME="7:21">7:21</A><DD>Art thou called <I>being</I> a servant? care not for it: but if thou mayest be made free, use <I>it</I> rather.
<DT><A NAME="7:22">7:22</A><DD>For he that is called in the Lord, <I>being</I> a servant, is the Lord's freeman: likewise also he that is called, <I>being</I> free, is Christ's servant.
<DT><A NAME="7:23">7:23</A><DD>Ye are bought with a price; be not ye the servants of men.
<DT><A NAME="7:24">7:24</A><DD>Brethren, let every man, wherein he is called, therein abide with God.
<DT><A NAME="7:25">7:25</A><DD>Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord: yet I give my judgment, as one that hath obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful.
<DT><A NAME="7:26">7:26</A><DD>I suppose therefore that this is good for the present distress, <I>I say</I>, that <I>it is</I> good for a man so to be.
<DT><A NAME="7:27">7:27</A><DD>Art thou bound unto a wife? seek not to be loosed. Art thou loosed from a wife? seek not a wife.
<DT><A NAME="7:28">7:28</A><DD>But and if thou marry, thou hast not sinned; and if a virgin marry, she hath not sinned. Nevertheless such shall have trouble in the flesh: but I spare you.
<DT><A NAME="7:29">7:29</A><DD>But this I say, brethren, the time <I>is</I> short: it remaineth, that both they that have wives be as though they had none;

<DT><A NAME="7:31">7:31</A><DD>And they that use this world, as not abusing <I>it</I>: for the fashion of this world passeth away.
<DT><A NAME="7:32">7:32</A><DD>But I would have you without carefulness. He that is unmarried careth for the things that belong to the Lord, how he may please the Lord:
<DT><A NAME="7:33">7:33</A><DD>But he that is married careth for the things that are of the world, how he may please <I>his</I> wife.
<DT><A NAME="7:34">7:34</A><DD>There is difference <I>also</I> between a wife and a virgin. The unmarried woman careth for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit: but she that is married careth for the things of the world, how she may please <I>her</I> husband.
<DT><A NAME="7:35">7:35</A><DD>And this I speak for your own profit; not that I may cast a snare upon you, but for that which is comely, and that ye may attend upon the Lord without distraction.
<DT><A NAME="7:36">7:36</A><DD>But if any man think that he behaveth himself uncomely toward his virgin, if she pass the flower of <I>her</I> age, and need so require, let him do what he will, he sinneth not: let them marry.
<DT><A NAME="7:37">7:37</A><DD>Nevertheless he that standeth stedfast in his heart, having no necessity, but hath power over his own will, and hath so decreed in his heart that he will keep his virgin, doeth well.
<DT><A NAME="7:38">7:38</A><DD>So then he that giveth <I>her</I> in marriage doeth well; but he that giveth <I>her</I> not in marriage doeth better.
<DT><A NAME="7:39">7:39</A><DD>The wife is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth; but if her husband be dead, she is at liberty to be married to whom she will; only in the Lord.
<DT><A NAME="7:40">7:40</A><DD>But she is happier if she so abide, after my judgment: and I think also that I have the Spirit of God.

<DT><A NAME="8:8">8:8</A><DD>But meat commendeth us not to God: for neither, if we eat, are we the better; neither, if we eat not, are we the worse.
<DT><A NAME="8:9">8:9</A><DD>But take heed lest by any means this liberty of yours become a stumblingblock to them that are weak.
<DT><A NAME="8:10">8:10</A><DD>For if any man see thee which hast knowledge sit at meat in the idol's temple, shall not the conscience of him which is weak be emboldened to eat those things which are offered to idols;

<DT><A NAME="15:3">15:3</A><DD>For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;
<DT><A NAME="15:4">15:4</A><DD>And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:
<DT><A NAME="15:5">15:5</A><DD>And that he was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve:
<DT><A NAME="15:6">15:6</A><DD>After that, he was seen of above five hundred brethren at once; of whom the greater part remain unto this present, but some are fallen asleep.
<DT><A NAME="15:7">15:7</A><DD>After that, he was seen of James; then of all the apostles.
<DT><A NAME="15:8">15:8</A><DD>And last of all he was seen of me also, as of one born out of due time.

<DT><A NAME="15:15">15:15</A><DD>Yea, and we are found false witnesses of God; because we have testified of God that he raised up Christ: whom he raised not up, if so be that the dead rise not.
<DT><A NAME="15:16">15:16</A><DD>For if the dead rise not, then is not Christ raised:
<DT><A NAME="15:17">15:17</A><DD>And if Christ be not raised, your faith <I>is</I> vain; ye are yet in your sins.
<DT><A NAME="15:18">15:18</A><DD>Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished.

<DT><A NAME="15:26">15:26</A><DD>The last enemy <I>that</I> shall be destroyed <I>is</I> death.
<DT><A NAME="15:27">15:27</A><DD>For he hath put all things under his feet. But when he saith all things are put under <I>him, it is</I> manifest that he is excepted, which did put all things under him.

<DT><A NAME="15:40">15:40</A><DD><I>There are</I> also celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial: but the glory of the celestial <I>is</I> one, and the <I>glory</I> of the terrestrial <I>is</I> another.
<DT><A NAME="15:41">15:41</A><DD><I>There is</I> one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars: for <I>one</I> star differeth from <I>another</I> star in glory.
<DT><A NAME="15:42">15:42</A><DD>So also <I>is</I> the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption:
<DT><A NAME="15:43">15:43</A><DD>It is sown in dishonour; it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness; it is raised in power:
<DT><A NAME="15:44">15:44</A><DD>It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body.
<DT><A NAME="15:45">15:45</A><DD>And so it is written, The first man Adam was made a living soul; the last Adam <I>was made</I> a quickening spirit.
<DT><A NAME="15:46">15:46</A><DD>Howbeit that <I>was</I> not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural; and afterward that which is spiritual.
<DT><A NAME="15:47">15:47</A><DD>The first man <I>is</I> of the earth, earthy: the second man <I>is</I> the Lord from heaven.
<DT><A NAME="15:48">15:48</A><DD>As <I>is</I> the earthy, such <I>are</I> they also that are earthy: and as <I>is</I> the heavenly, such <I>are</I> they also that are heavenly.
<DT><A NAME="15:49">15:49</A><DD>And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly.

<DT><A NAME="15:51">15:51</A><DD>Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,

<DT><A NAME="15:54">15:54</A><DD>So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.
