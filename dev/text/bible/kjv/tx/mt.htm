<DT><A NAME="1:2">1:2</A><DD>Abraham begat Isaac; and Isaac begat Jacob; and Jacob begat Judas and his brethren;
<DT><A NAME="1:3">1:3</A><DD>And Judas begat Phares and Zara of Thamar; and Phares begat Esrom; and Esrom begat Aram;
<DT><A NAME="1:4">1:4</A><DD>And Aram begat Aminadab; and Aminadab begat Naasson; and Naasson begat Salmon;
<DT><A NAME="1:5">1:5</A><DD>And Salmon begat Booz of Rachab; and Booz begat Obed of Ruth; and Obed begat Jesse;
<DT><A NAME="1:6">1:6</A><DD>And Jesse begat David the king; and David the king begat Solomon of her <I>that had been the wife</I> of Urias;
<DT><A NAME="1:7">1:7</A><DD>And Solomon begat Roboam; and Roboam begat Abia; and Abia begat Asa;
<DT><A NAME="1:8">1:8</A><DD>And Asa begat Josaphat; and Josaphat begat Joram; and Joram begat Ozias;
<DT><A NAME="1:9">1:9</A><DD>And Ozias begat Joatham; and Joatham begat Achaz; and Achaz begat Ezekias;
<DT><A NAME="1:10">1:10</A><DD>And Ezekias begat Manasses; and Manasses begat Amon; and Amon begat Josias;
<DT><A NAME="1:11">1:11</A><DD>And Josias begat Jechonias and his brethren, about the time they were carried away to Babylon:
<DT><A NAME="1:12">1:12</A><DD>And after they were brought to Babylon, Jechonias begat Salathiel; and Salathiel begat Zorobabel;
<DT><A NAME="1:13">1:13</A><DD>And Zorobabel begat Abiud; and Abiud begat Eliakim; and Eliakim begat Azor;
<DT><A NAME="1:14">1:14</A><DD>And Azor begat Sadoc; and Sadoc begat Achim; and Achim begat Eliud;

<DT><A NAME="1:16">1:16</A><DD>And Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ.
<DT><A NAME="1:17">1:17</A><DD>So all the generations from Abraham to David <I>are</I> fourteen generations; and from David until the carrying away into Babylon <I>are</I> fourteen generations; and from the carrying away into Babylon unto Christ <I>are</I> fourteen generations.
<DT><A NAME="1:18">1:18</A><DD>Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child of the Holy Ghost.
<DT><A NAME="1:19">1:19</A><DD>Then Joseph her husband, being a just <I>man</I>, and not willing to make her a publick example, was minded to put her away privily.
<DT><A NAME="1:20">1:20</A><DD>But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost.
<DT><A NAME="1:21">1:21</A><DD>And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name JESUS: for he shall save his people from their sins.
<DT><A NAME="1:22">1:22</A><DD>Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying,
<DT><A NAME="1:23">1:23</A><DD>Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us.
<DT><A NAME="1:24">1:24</A><DD>Then Joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him, and took unto him his wife:
<DT><A NAME="1:25">1:25</A><DD>And knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son: and he called his name JESUS.
</DL></DIV><H2>Chapter 2</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="2:1">2:1</A><DD>Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaea in the days of Herod the king, behold, there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem,
<DT><A NAME="2:2">2:2</A><DD>Saying, Where is he that is born King of the Jews? for we have seen his star in the east, and are come to worship him.
<DT><A NAME="2:3">2:3</A><DD>When Herod the king had heard <I>these things</I>, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.
<DT><A NAME="2:4">2:4</A><DD>And when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together, he demanded of them where Christ should be born.
<DT><A NAME="2:5">2:5</A><DD>And they said unto him, In Bethlehem of Judaea: for thus it is written by the prophet,
<DT><A NAME="2:6">2:6</A><DD>And thou Bethlehem, <I>in</I> the land of Juda, art not the least among the princes of Juda: for out of thee shall come a Governor, that shall rule my people Israel.
<DT><A NAME="2:7">2:7</A><DD>Then Herod, when he had privily called the wise men, enquired of them diligently what time the star appeared.
<DT><A NAME="2:8">2:8</A><DD>And he sent them to Bethlehem, and said, Go and search diligently for the young child; and when ye have found <I>him</I>, bring me word again, that I may come and worship him also.
<DT><A NAME="2:9">2:9</A><DD>When they had heard the king, they departed; and, lo, the star, which they saw in the east, went before them, till it came and stood over where the young child was.
<DT><A NAME="2:10">2:10</A><DD>When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy.
<DT><A NAME="2:11">2:11</A><DD>And when they were come into the house, they saw the young child with Mary his mother, and fell down, and worshipped him: and when they had opened their treasures, they presented unto him gifts; gold, and frankincense, and myrrh.
<DT><A NAME="2:12">2:12</A><DD>And being warned of God in a dream that they should not return to Herod, they departed into their own country another way.
<DT><A NAME="2:13">2:13</A><DD>And when they were departed, behold, the angel of the Lord appeareth to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and be thou there until I bring thee word: for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him.
<DT><A NAME="2:14">2:14</A><DD>When he arose, he took the young child and his mother by night, and departed into Egypt:
<DT><A NAME="2:15">2:15</A><DD>And was there until the death of Herod: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying, Out of Egypt have I called my son.
<DT><A NAME="2:16">2:16</A><DD>Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked of the wise men, was exceeding wroth, and sent forth, and slew all the children that were in Bethlehem, and in all the coasts thereof, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had diligently enquired of the wise men.
<DT><A NAME="2:17">2:17</A><DD>Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet, saying,
<DT><A NAME="2:18">2:18</A><DD>In Rama was there a voice heard, lamentation, and weeping, and great mourning, Rachel weeping <I>for</I> her children, and would not be comforted, because they are not.
<DT><A NAME="2:19">2:19</A><DD>But when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appeareth in a dream to Joseph in Egypt,
<DT><A NAME="2:20">2:20</A><DD>Saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and go into the land of Israel: for they are dead which sought the young child's life.
<DT><A NAME="2:21">2:21</A><DD>And he arose, and took the young child and his mother, and came into the land of Israel.
<DT><A NAME="2:22">2:22</A><DD>But when he heard that Archelaus did reign in Judaea in the room of his father Herod, he was afraid to go thither: notwithstanding, being warned of God in a dream, he turned aside into the parts of Galilee:
<DT><A NAME="2:23">2:23</A><DD>And he came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets, He shall be called a Nazarene.
</DL></DIV><H2>Chapter 3</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="3:1">3:1</A><DD>In those days came John the Baptist, preaching in the wilderness of Judaea,
<DT><A NAME="3:2">3:2</A><DD>And saying, Repent ye: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.
<DT><A NAME="3:3">3:3</A><DD>For this is he that was spoken of by the prophet Esaias, saying, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.
<DT><A NAME="3:4">3:4</A><DD>And the same John had his raiment of camel's hair, and a leathern girdle about his loins; and his meat was locusts and wild honey.
<DT><A NAME="3:5">3:5</A><DD>Then went out to him Jerusalem, and all Judaea, and all the region round about Jordan,
<DT><A NAME="3:6">3:6</A><DD>And were baptized of him in Jordan, confessing their sins.
<DT><A NAME="3:7">3:7</A><DD>But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees come to his baptism, he said unto them, O generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come?
<DT><A NAME="3:8">3:8</A><DD>Bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance:
<DT><A NAME="3:9">3:9</A><DD>And think not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to <I>our</I> father: for I say unto you, that God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham.
<DT><A NAME="3:10">3:10</A><DD>And now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees: therefore every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.
<DT><A NAME="3:11">3:11</A><DD>I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance: but he that cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear: he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and <I>with</I> fire:
<DT><A NAME="3:12">3:12</A><DD>Whose fan <I>is</I> in his hand, and he will throughly purge his floor, and gather his wheat into the garner; but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.
<DT><A NAME="3:13">3:13</A><DD>Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John, to be baptized of him.
<DT><A NAME="3:14">3:14</A><DD>But John forbad him, saying, I have need to be baptized of thee, and comest thou to me?
<DT><A NAME="3:15">3:15</A><DD>And Jesus answering said unto him, <FONT CLASS=r>Suffer <I>it to be so</I> now: for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness.</FONT> Then he suffered him.
<DT><A NAME="3:16">3:16</A><DD>And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the water: and, lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting upon him:
<DT><A NAME="3:17">3:17</A><DD>And lo a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.
</DL></DIV><H2>Chapter 4</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="4:1">4:1</A><DD>Then was Jesus led up of the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil.
<DT><A NAME="4:2">4:2</A><DD>And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he was afterward an hungred.
<DT><A NAME="4:3">4:3</A><DD>And when the tempter came to him, he said, If thou be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread.
<DT><A NAME="4:4">4:4</A><DD>But he answered and said, <FONT CLASS=r>It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.</FONT>
<DT><A NAME="4:5">4:5</A><DD>Then the devil taketh him up into the holy city, and setteth him on a pinnacle of the temple,
<DT><A NAME="4:6">4:6</A><DD>And saith unto him, If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down: for it is written, He shall give his angels charge concerning thee: and in <I>their</I> hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone.
<DT><A NAME="4:7">4:7</A><DD>Jesus said unto him, <FONT CLASS=r>It is written again, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.</FONT>
<DT><A NAME="4:8">4:8</A><DD>Again, the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain, and sheweth him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them;
<DT><A NAME="4:9">4:9</A><DD>And saith unto him, All these things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me.
<DT><A NAME="4:10">4:10</A><DD>Then saith Jesus unto him, <FONT CLASS=r>Get thee hence, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.</FONT>
<DT><A NAME="4:11">4:11</A><DD>Then the devil leaveth him, and, behold, angels came and ministered unto him.
<DT><A NAME="4:12">4:12</A><DD>Now when Jesus had heard that John was cast into prison, he departed into Galilee;
<DT><A NAME="4:13">4:13</A><DD>And leaving Nazareth, he came and dwelt in Capernaum, which is upon the sea coast, in the borders of Zabulon and Nephthalim:
<DT><A NAME="4:14">4:14</A><DD>That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying,
<DT><A NAME="4:15">4:15</A><DD>The land of Zabulon, and the land of Nephthalim, <I>by</I> the way of the sea, beyond Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles;
<DT><A NAME="4:16">4:16</A><DD>The people which sat in darkness saw great light; and to them which sat in the region and shadow of death light is sprung up.
<DT><A NAME="4:17">4:17</A><DD>From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, <FONT CLASS=r>Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.</FONT>
<DT><A NAME="4:18">4:18</A><DD>And Jesus, walking by the sea of Galilee, saw two brethren, Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers.
<DT><A NAME="4:19">4:19</A><DD>And he saith unto them, <FONT CLASS=r>Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.</FONT>
<DT><A NAME="4:20">4:20</A><DD>And they straightway left <I>their</I> nets, and followed him.
<DT><A NAME="4:21">4:21</A><DD>And going on from thence, he saw other two brethren, James <I>the son</I> of Zebedee, and John his brother, in a ship with Zebedee their father, mending their nets; and he called them.
<DT><A NAME="4:22">4:22</A><DD>And they immediately left the ship and their father, and followed him.
<DT><A NAME="4:23">4:23</A><DD>And Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing all manner of sickness and all manner of disease among the people.
<DT><A NAME="4:24">4:24</A><DD>And his fame went throughout all Syria: and they brought unto him all sick people that were taken with divers diseases and torments, and those which were possessed with devils, and those which were lunatick, and those that had the palsy; and he healed them.
<DT><A NAME="4:25">4:25</A><DD>And there followed him great multitudes of people from Galilee, and <I>from</I> Decapolis, and <I>from</I> Jerusalem, and <I>from</I> Judaea, and <I>from</I> beyond Jordan.
</DL></DIV><H2>Chapter 5</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="5:1">5:1</A><DD>And seeing the multitudes, he went up into a mountain: and when he was set, his disciples came unto him:
<DT><A NAME="5:2">5:2</A><DD>And he opened his mouth, and taught them, saying,

<DT><A NAME="26:41">26:41</A><DD><FONT CLASS=r>Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed <I>is</I> willing, but the flesh <I>is</I> weak.</FONT>
<DT><A NAME="26:42">26:42</A><DD>He went away again the second time, and prayed, saying, <FONT CLASS=r>O my Father, if this cup may not pass away from me, except I drink it, thy will be done.</FONT>
<DT><A NAME="26:43">26:43</A><DD>And he came and found them asleep again: for their eyes were heavy.
<DT><A NAME="26:44">26:44</A><DD>And he left them, and went away again, and prayed the third time, saying the same words.
<DT><A NAME="26:45">26:45</A><DD>Then cometh he to his disciples, and saith unto them, <FONT CLASS=r>Sleep on now, and take <I>your</I> rest: behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.</FONT>
<DT><A NAME="26:46">26:46</A><DD><FONT CLASS=r>Rise, let us be going: behold, he is at hand that doth betray me.</FONT>
<DT><A NAME="26:47">26:47</A><DD>And while he yet spake, lo, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and elders of the people.
<DT><A NAME="26:48">26:48</A><DD>Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he: hold him fast.
<DT><A NAME="26:49">26:49</A><DD>And forthwith he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, master; and kissed him.
<DT><A NAME="26:50">26:50</A><DD>And Jesus said unto him, <FONT CLASS=r>Friend, wherefore art thou come?</FONT> Then came they, and laid hands on Jesus, and took him.
<DT><A NAME="26:51">26:51</A><DD>And, behold, one of them which were with Jesus stretched out <I>his</I> hand, and drew his sword, and struck a servant of the high priest's, and smote off his ear.
<DT><A NAME="26:52">26:52</A><DD>Then said Jesus unto him, <FONT CLASS=r>Put up again thy sword into his place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword.</FONT>
<DT><A NAME="26:53">26:53</A><DD><FONT CLASS=r>Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels?</FONT>
<DT><A NAME="26:54">26:54</A><DD><FONT CLASS=r>But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be?</FONT>
<DT><A NAME="26:55">26:55</A><DD>In that same hour said Jesus to the multitudes, <FONT CLASS=r>Are ye come out as against a thief with swords and staves for to take me? I sat daily with you teaching in the temple, and ye laid no hold on me.</FONT>
<DT><A NAME="26:56">26:56</A><DD><FONT CLASS=r>But all this was done, that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled.</FONT> Then all the disciples forsook him, and fled.
<DT><A NAME="26:57">26:57</A><DD>And they that had laid hold on Jesus led <I>him</I> away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were assembled.
<DT><A NAME="26:58">26:58</A><DD>But Peter followed him afar off unto the high priest's palace, and went in, and sat with the servants, to see the end.
<DT><A NAME="26:59">26:59</A><DD>Now the chief priests, and elders, and all the council, sought false witness against Jesus, to put him to death;
<DT><A NAME="26:60">26:60</A><DD>But found none: yea, though many false witnesses came, <I>yet</I> found they none. At the last came two false witnesses,
<DT><A NAME="26:61">26:61</A><DD>And said, This <I>fellow</I> said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days.
<DT><A NAME="26:62">26:62</A><DD>And the high priest arose, and said unto him, Answerest thou nothing? what <I>is it which</I> these witness against thee?
<DT><A NAME="26:63">26:63</A><DD>But Jesus held his peace. And the high priest answered and said unto him, I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us whether thou be the Christ, the Son of God.
<DT><A NAME="26:64">26:64</A><DD>Jesus saith unto him, <FONT CLASS=r>Thou hast said: nevertheless I say unto you, Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.</FONT>
<DT><A NAME="26:65">26:65</A><DD>Then the high priest rent his clothes, saying, He hath spoken blasphemy; what further need have we of witnesses? behold, now ye have heard his blasphemy.
<DT><A NAME="26:66">26:66</A><DD>What think ye? They answered and said, He is guilty of death.
<DT><A NAME="26:67">26:67</A><DD>Then did they spit in his face, and buffeted him; and others smote <I>him</I> with the palms of their hands,
<DT><A NAME="26:68">26:68</A><DD>Saying, Prophesy unto us, thou Christ, Who is he that smote thee?
<DT><A NAME="26:69">26:69</A><DD>Now Peter sat without in the palace: and a damsel came unto him, saying, Thou also wast with Jesus of Galilee.
<DT><A NAME="26:70">26:70</A><DD>But he denied before <I>them</I> all, saying, I know not what thou sayest.
<DT><A NAME="26:71">26:71</A><DD>And when he was gone out into the porch, another <I>maid</I> saw him, and said unto them that were there, This <I>fellow</I> was also with Jesus of Nazareth.
<DT><A NAME="26:72">26:72</A><DD>And again he denied with an oath, I do not know the man.
<DT><A NAME="26:73">26:73</A><DD>And after a while came unto <I>him</I> they that stood by, and said to Peter, Surely thou also art <I>one</I> of them; for thy speech bewrayeth thee.
<DT><A NAME="26:74">26:74</A><DD>Then began he to curse and to swear, <I>saying</I>, I know not the man. And immediately the cock crew.
<DT><A NAME="26:75">26:75</A><DD>And Peter remembered the word of Jesus, which said unto him, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. And he went out, and wept bitterly.
</DL></DIV><H2>Chapter 27</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="27:1">27:1</A><DD>When the morning was come, all the chief priests and elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death:
<DT><A NAME="27:2">27:2</A><DD>And when they had bound him, they led <I>him</I> away, and delivered him to Pontius Pilate the governor.
<DT><A NAME="27:3">27:3</A><DD>Then Judas, which had betrayed him, when he saw that he was condemned, repented himself, and brought again the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders,
<DT><A NAME="27:4">27:4</A><DD>Saying, I have sinned in that I have betrayed the innocent blood. And they said, What <I>is that</I> to us? see thou <I>to that</I>.
<DT><A NAME="27:5">27:5</A><DD>And he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple, and departed, and went and hanged himself.
<DT><A NAME="27:6">27:6</A><DD>And the chief priests took the silver pieces, and said, It is not lawful for to put them into the treasury, because it is the price of blood.
<DT><A NAME="27:7">27:7</A><DD>And they took counsel, and bought with them the potter's field, to bury strangers in.
<DT><A NAME="27:8">27:8</A><DD>Wherefore that field was called, The field of blood, unto this day.
<DT><A NAME="27:9">27:9</A><DD>Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet, saying, And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that was valued, whom they of the children of Israel did value;
<DT><A NAME="27:10">27:10</A><DD>And gave them for the potter's field, as the Lord appointed me.
<DT><A NAME="27:11">27:11</A><DD>And Jesus stood before the governor: and the governor asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And Jesus said unto him, <FONT CLASS=r>Thou sayest.</FONT>
<DT><A NAME="27:12">27:12</A><DD>And when he was accused of the chief priests and elders, he answered nothing.
<DT><A NAME="27:13">27:13</A><DD>Then said Pilate unto him, Hearest thou not how many things they witness against thee?
<DT><A NAME="27:14">27:14</A><DD>And he answered him to never a word; insomuch that the governor marvelled greatly.
<DT><A NAME="27:15">27:15</A><DD>Now at <I>that</I> feast the governor was wont to release unto the people a prisoner, whom they would.
<DT><A NAME="27:16">27:16</A><DD>And they had then a notable prisoner, called Barabbas.
<DT><A NAME="27:17">27:17</A><DD>Therefore when they were gathered together, Pilate said unto them, Whom will ye that I release unto you? Barabbas, or Jesus which is called Christ?
<DT><A NAME="27:18">27:18</A><DD>For he knew that for envy they had delivered him.
<DT><A NAME="27:19">27:19</A><DD>When he was set down on the judgment seat, his wife sent unto him, saying, Have thou nothing to do with that just man: for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him.
<DT><A NAME="27:20">27:20</A><DD>But the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitude that they should ask Barabbas, and destroy Jesus.
<DT><A NAME="27:21">27:21</A><DD>The governor answered and said unto them, Whether of the twain will ye that I release unto you? They said, Barabbas.
<DT><A NAME="27:22">27:22</A><DD>Pilate saith unto them, What shall I do then with Jesus which is called Christ? <I>They</I> all say unto him, Let him be crucified.
<DT><A NAME="27:23">27:23</A><DD>And the governor said, Why, what evil hath he done? But they cried out the more, saying, Let him be crucified.
<DT><A NAME="27:24">27:24</A><DD>When Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing, but <I>that</I> rather a tumult was made, he took water, and washed <I>his</I> hands before the multitude, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this just person: see ye <I>to it</I>.
<DT><A NAME="27:25">27:25</A><DD>Then answered all the people, and said, His blood <I>be</I> on us, and on our children.
<DT><A NAME="27:26">27:26</A><DD>Then released he Barabbas unto them: and when he had scourged Jesus, he delivered <I>him</I> to be crucified.
<DT><A NAME="27:27">27:27</A><DD>Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the common hall, and gathered unto him the whole band <I>of soldiers</I>.
<DT><A NAME="27:28">27:28</A><DD>And they stripped him, and put on him a scarlet robe.
<DT><A NAME="27:29">27:29</A><DD>And when they had platted a crown of thorns, they put <I>it</I> upon his head, and a reed in his right hand: and they bowed the knee before him, and mocked him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews!
<DT><A NAME="27:30">27:30</A><DD>And they spit upon him, and took the reed, and smote him on the head.
<DT><A NAME="27:31">27:31</A><DD>And after that they had mocked him, they took the robe off from him, and put his own raiment on him, and led him away to crucify <I>him</I>.
<DT><A NAME="27:32">27:32</A><DD>And as they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name: him they compelled to bear his cross.
<DT><A NAME="27:33">27:33</A><DD>And when they were come unto a place called Golgotha, that is to say, a place of a skull,
<DT><A NAME="27:34">27:34</A><DD>They gave him vinegar to drink mingled with gall: and when he had tasted <I>thereof</I>, he would not drink.
<DT><A NAME="27:35">27:35</A><DD>And they crucified him, and parted his garments, casting lots: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, They parted my garments among them, and upon my vesture did they cast lots.
<DT><A NAME="27:36">27:36</A><DD>And sitting down they watched him there;
<DT><A NAME="27:37">27:37</A><DD>And set up over his head his accusation written, THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.
<DT><A NAME="27:38">27:38</A><DD>Then were there two thieves crucified with him, one on the right hand, and another on the left.
<DT><A NAME="27:39">27:39</A><DD>And they that passed by reviled him, wagging their heads,
<DT><A NAME="27:40">27:40</A><DD>And saying, Thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest <I>it</I> in three days, save thyself. If thou be the Son of God, come down from the cross.
<DT><A NAME="27:41">27:41</A><DD>Likewise also the chief priests mocking <I>him</I>, with the scribes and elders, said,
<DT><A NAME="27:42">27:42</A><DD>He saved others; himself he cannot save. If he be the King of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe him.
<DT><A NAME="27:43">27:43</A><DD>He trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if he will have him: for he said, I am the Son of God.
<DT><A NAME="27:44">27:44</A><DD>The thieves also, which were crucified with him, cast the same in his teeth.
<DT><A NAME="27:45">27:45</A><DD>Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land unto the ninth hour.
<DT><A NAME="27:46">27:46</A><DD>And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, <FONT CLASS=r>Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?</FONT> that is to say, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?
<DT><A NAME="27:47">27:47</A><DD>Some of them that stood there, when they heard <I>that</I>, said, This <I>man</I> calleth for Elias.
<DT><A NAME="27:48">27:48</A><DD>And straightway one of them ran, and took a spunge, and filled <I>it</I> with vinegar, and put <I>it</I> on a reed, and gave him to drink.
<DT><A NAME="27:49">27:49</A><DD>The rest said, Let be, let us see whether Elias will come to save him.
<DT><A NAME="27:50">27:50</A><DD>Jesus, when he had cried again with a loud voice, yielded up the ghost.
<DT><A NAME="27:51">27:51</A><DD>And, behold, the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom; and the earth did quake, and the rocks rent;
<DT><A NAME="27:52">27:52</A><DD>And the graves were opened; and many bodies of the saints which slept arose,
<DT><A NAME="27:53">27:53</A><DD>And came out of the graves after his resurrection, and went into the holy city, and appeared unto many.
<DT><A NAME="27:54">27:54</A><DD>Now when the centurion, and they that were with him, watching Jesus, saw the earthquake, and those things that were done, they feared greatly, saying, Truly this was the Son of God.
<DT><A NAME="27:55">27:55</A><DD>And many women were there beholding afar off, which followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering unto him:
<DT><A NAME="27:56">27:56</A><DD>Among which was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of Zebedee's children.
<DT><A NAME="27:57">27:57</A><DD>When the even was come, there came a rich man of Arimathaea, named Joseph, who also himself was Jesus' disciple:
<DT><A NAME="27:58">27:58</A><DD>He went to Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded the body to be delivered.
<DT><A NAME="27:59">27:59</A><DD>And when Joseph had taken the body, he wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,
<DT><A NAME="27:60">27:60</A><DD>And laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock: and he rolled a great stone to the door of the sepulchre, and departed.
<DT><A NAME="27:61">27:61</A><DD>And there was Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary, sitting over against the sepulchre.
<DT><A NAME="27:62">27:62</A><DD>Now the next day, that followed the day of the preparation, the chief priests and Pharisees came together unto Pilate,
<DT><A NAME="27:63">27:63</A><DD>Saying, Sir, we remember that that deceiver said, while he was yet alive, After three days I will rise again.
<DT><A NAME="27:64">27:64</A><DD>Command therefore that the sepulchre be made sure until the third day, lest his disciples come by night, and steal him away, and say unto the people, He is risen from the dead: so the last error shall be worse than the first.
<DT><A NAME="27:65">27:65</A><DD>Pilate said unto them, Ye have a watch: go your way, make <I>it</I> as sure as ye can.
<DT><A NAME="27:66">27:66</A><DD>So they went, and made the sepulchre sure, sealing the stone, and setting a watch.
</DL></DIV><H2>Chapter 28</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="28:1">28:1</A><DD>In the end of the sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first <I>day</I> of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre.
<DT><A NAME="28:2">28:2</A><DD>And, behold, there was a great earthquake: for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from the door, and sat upon it.
<DT><A NAME="28:3">28:3</A><DD>His countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow:
<DT><A NAME="28:4">28:4</A><DD>And for fear of him the keepers did shake, and became as dead <I>men</I>.
<DT><A NAME="28:5">28:5</A><DD>And the angel answered and said unto the women, Fear not ye: for I know that ye seek Jesus, which was crucified.
<DT><A NAME="28:6">28:6</A><DD>He is not here: for he is risen, as he said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay.
<DT><A NAME="28:7">28:7</A><DD>And go quickly, and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead; and, behold, he goeth before you into Galilee; there shall ye see him: lo, I have told you.
<DT><A NAME="28:8">28:8</A><DD>And they departed quickly from the sepulchre with fear and great joy; and did run to bring his disciples word.
<DT><A NAME="28:9">28:9</A><DD>And as they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, <FONT CLASS=r>All hail.</FONT> And they came and held him by the feet, and worshipped him.
<DT><A NAME="28:10">28:10</A><DD>Then said Jesus unto them, <FONT CLASS=r>Be not afraid: go tell my brethren that they go into Galilee, and there shall they see me.</FONT>
<DT><A NAME="28:11">28:11</A><DD>Now when they were going, behold, some of the watch came into the city, and shewed unto the chief priests all the things that were done.
<DT><A NAME="28:12">28:12</A><DD>And when they were assembled with the elders, and had taken counsel, they gave large money unto the soldiers,
<DT><A NAME="28:13">28:13</A><DD>Saying, Say ye, His disciples came by night, and stole him <I>away</I> while we slept.
<DT><A NAME="28:14">28:14</A><DD>And if this come to the governor's ears, we will persuade him, and secure you.
<DT><A NAME="28:15">28:15</A><DD>So they took the money, and did as they were taught: and this saying is commonly reported among the Jews until this day.
<DT><A NAME="28:16">28:16</A><DD>Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, into a mountain where Jesus had appointed them.
<DT><A NAME="28:17">28:17</A><DD>And when they saw him, they worshipped him: but some doubted.
<DT><A NAME="28:18">28:18</A><DD>And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, <FONT CLASS=r>All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.</FONT>
<DT><A NAME="28:19">28:19</A><DD><FONT CLASS=r>Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:</FONT>
