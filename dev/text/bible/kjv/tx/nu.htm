<DT><A NAME="22:31">22:31</A><DD>Then the LORD opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand: and he bowed down his head, and fell flat on his face.
<DT><A NAME="22:32">22:32</A><DD>And the angel of the LORD said unto him, Wherefore hast thou smitten thine ass these three times? behold, I went out to withstand thee, because <I>thy</I> way is perverse before me:
<DT><A NAME="22:33">22:33</A><DD>And the ass saw me, and turned from me these three times: unless she had turned from me, surely now also I had slain thee, and saved her alive.
<DT><A NAME="22:34">22:34</A><DD>And Balaam said unto the angel of the LORD, I have sinned; for I knew not that thou stoodest in the way against me: now therefore, if it displease thee, I will get me back again.
<DT><A NAME="22:35">22:35</A><DD>And the angel of the LORD said unto Balaam, Go with the men: but only the word that I shall speak unto thee, that thou shalt speak. So Balaam went with the princes of Balak.

<DT><A NAME="32:8">32:8</A><DD>Thus did your fathers, when I sent them from Kadeshbarnea to see the land.
<DT><A NAME="32:9">32:9</A><DD>For when they went up unto the valley of Eshcol, and saw the land, they discouraged the heart of the children of Israel, that they should not go into the land which the LORD had given them.
