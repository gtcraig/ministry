<H2>Chapter 1</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="1:1">1:1</A><DD>These <I>be</I> the words which Moses spake unto all Israel on this side Jordan in the wilderness, in the plain over against the Red <I>sea</I>, between Paran, and Tophel, and Laban, and Hazeroth, and Dizahab.
<DT><A NAME="1:2">1:2</A><DD>(<I>There are</I> eleven days' <I>journey</I> from Horeb by the way of mount Seir unto Kadeshbarnea.)
<DT><A NAME="1:3">1:3</A><DD>And it came to pass in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first <I>day</I> of the month, <I>that</I> Moses spake unto the children of Israel, according unto all that the LORD had given him in commandment unto them;
<DT><A NAME="1:4">1:4</A><DD>After he had slain Sihon the king of the Amorites, which dwelt in Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, which dwelt at Astaroth in Edrei:
<DT><A NAME="1:5">1:5</A><DD>On this side Jordan, in the land of Moab, began Moses to declare this law, saying,
<DT><A NAME="1:6">1:6</A><DD>The LORD our God spake unto us in Horeb, saying, Ye have dwelt long enough in this mount:
<DT><A NAME="1:7">1:7</A><DD>Turn you, and take your journey, and go to the mount of the Amorites, and unto all <I>the places</I> nigh thereunto, in the plain, in the hills, and in the vale, and in the south, and by the sea side, to the land of the Canaanites, and unto Lebanon, unto the great river, the river Euphrates.
<DT><A NAME="1:8">1:8</A><DD>Behold, I have set the land before you: go in and possess the land which the LORD sware unto your fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to give unto them and to their seed after them.
<DT><A NAME="1:9">1:9</A><DD>And I spake unto you at that time, saying, I am not able to bear you myself alone:
<DT><A NAME="1:10">1:10</A><DD>The LORD your God hath multiplied you, and, behold, ye <I>are</I> this day as the stars of heaven for multitude.
<DT><A NAME="1:11">1:11</A><DD>(The LORD God of your fathers make you a thousand times so many more as ye <I>are</I>, and bless you, as he hath promised you!)
<DT><A NAME="1:12">1:12</A><DD>How can I myself alone bear your cumbrance, and your burden, and your strife?
<DT><A NAME="1:13">1:13</A><DD>Take you wise men, and understanding, and known among your tribes, and I will make them rulers over you.
<DT><A NAME="1:14">1:14</A><DD>And ye answered me, and said, The thing which thou hast spoken <I>is</I> good <I>for us</I> to do.
<DT><A NAME="1:15">1:15</A><DD>So I took the chief of your tribes, wise men, and known, and made them heads over you, captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, and captains over fifties, and captains over tens, and officers among your tribes.
<DT><A NAME="1:16">1:16</A><DD>And I charged your judges at that time, saying, Hear <I>the causes</I> between your brethren, and judge righteously between <I>every</I> man and his brother, and the stranger <I>that is</I> with him.
<DT><A NAME="1:17">1:17</A><DD>Ye shall not respect persons in judgment; <I>but</I> ye shall hear the small as well as the great; ye shall not be afraid of the face of man; for the judgment <I>is</I> God's: and the cause that is too hard for you, bring <I>it</I> unto me, and I will hear it.
<DT><A NAME="1:18">1:18</A><DD>And I commanded you at that time all the things which ye should do.
<DT><A NAME="1:19">1:19</A><DD>And when we departed from Horeb, we went through all that great and terrible wilderness, which ye saw by the way of the mountain of the Amorites, as the LORD our God commanded us; and we came to Kadeshbarnea.
<DT><A NAME="1:20">1:20</A><DD>And I said unto you, Ye are come unto the mountain of the Amorites, which the LORD our God doth give unto us.
<DT><A NAME="1:21">1:21</A><DD>Behold, the LORD thy God hath set the land before thee: go up <I>and</I> possess <I>it</I>, as the LORD God of thy fathers hath said unto thee; fear not, neither be discouraged.
<DT><A NAME="1:22">1:22</A><DD>And ye came near unto me every one of you, and said, We will send men before us, and they shall search us out the land, and bring us word again by what way we must go up, and into what cities we shall come.
<DT><A NAME="1:23">1:23</A><DD>And the saying pleased me well: and I took twelve men of you, one of a tribe:
<DT><A NAME="1:24">1:24</A><DD>And they turned and went up into the mountain, and came unto the valley of Eshcol, and searched it out.
<DT><A NAME="1:25">1:25</A><DD>And they took of the fruit of the land in their hands, and brought <I>it</I> down unto us, and brought us word again, and said, <I>It is</I> a good land which the LORD our God doth give us.
<DT><A NAME="1:26">1:26</A><DD>Notwithstanding ye would not go up, but rebelled against the commandment of the LORD your God:
<DT><A NAME="1:27">1:27</A><DD>And ye murmured in your tents, and said, Because the LORD hated us, he hath brought us forth out of the land of Egypt, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us.
<DT><A NAME="1:28">1:28</A><DD>Whither shall we go up? our brethren have discouraged our heart, saying, The people <I>is</I> greater and taller than we; the cities <I>are</I> great and walled up to heaven; and moreover we have seen the sons of the Anakims there.
<DT><A NAME="1:29">1:29</A><DD>Then I said unto you, Dread not, neither be afraid of them.
<DT><A NAME="1:30">1:30</A><DD>The LORD your God which goeth before you, he shall fight for you, according to all that he did for you in Egypt before your eyes;
<DT><A NAME="1:31">1:31</A><DD>And in the wilderness, where thou hast seen how that the LORD thy God bare thee, as a man doth bear his son, in all the way that ye went, until ye came into this place.
<DT><A NAME="1:32">1:32</A><DD>Yet in this thing ye did not believe the LORD your God,
<DT><A NAME="1:33">1:33</A><DD>Who went in the way before you, to search you out a place to pitch your tents <I>in</I>, in fire by night, to shew you by what way ye should go, and in a cloud by day.
<DT><A NAME="1:34">1:34</A><DD>And the LORD heard the voice of your words, and was wroth, and sware, saying,
<DT><A NAME="1:35">1:35</A><DD>Surely there shall not one of these men of this evil generation see that good land, which I sware to give unto your fathers,
<DT><A NAME="1:36">1:36</A><DD>Save Caleb the son of Jephunneh; he shall see it, and to him will I give the land that he hath trodden upon, and to his children, because he hath wholly followed the LORD.
<DT><A NAME="1:37">1:37</A><DD>Also the LORD was angry with me for your sakes, saying, Thou also shalt not go in thither.
<DT><A NAME="1:38">1:38</A><DD><I>But</I> Joshua the son of Nun, which standeth before thee, he shall go in thither: encourage him: for he shall cause Israel to inherit it.
<DT><A NAME="1:39">1:39</A><DD>Moreover your little ones, which ye said should be a prey, and your children, which in that day had no knowledge between good and evil, they shall go in thither, and unto them will I give it, and they shall possess it.
<DT><A NAME="1:40">1:40</A><DD>But <I>as for</I> you, turn you, and take your journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea.
<DT><A NAME="1:41">1:41</A><DD>Then ye answered and said unto me, We have sinned against the LORD, we will go up and fight, according to all that the LORD our God commanded us. And when ye had girded on every man his weapons of war, ye were ready to go up into the hill.
<DT><A NAME="1:42">1:42</A><DD>And the LORD said unto me, Say unto them, Go not up, neither fight; for I <I>am</I> not among you; lest ye be smitten before your enemies.
<DT><A NAME="1:43">1:43</A><DD>So I spake unto you; and ye would not hear, but rebelled against the commandment of the LORD, and went presumptuously up into the hill.
<DT><A NAME="1:44">1:44</A><DD>And the Amorites, which dwelt in that mountain, came out against you, and chased you, as bees do, and destroyed you in Seir, <I>even</I> unto Hormah.
<DT><A NAME="1:45">1:45</A><DD>And ye returned and wept before the LORD; but the LORD would not hearken to your voice, nor give ear unto you.
<DT><A NAME="1:46">1:46</A><DD>So ye abode in Kadesh many days, according unto the days that ye abode <I>there</I>.
</DL></DIV><H2>Chapter 2</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="2:1">2:1</A><DD>Then we turned, and took our journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea, as the LORD spake unto me: and we compassed mount Seir many days.
<DT><A NAME="2:2">2:2</A><DD>And the LORD spake unto me, saying,
<DT><A NAME="2:3">2:3</A><DD>Ye have compassed this mountain long enough: turn you northward.
<DT><A NAME="2:4">2:4</A><DD>And command thou the people, saying, Ye <I>are</I> to pass through the coast of your brethren the children of Esau, which dwell in Seir; and they shall be afraid of you: take ye good heed unto yourselves therefore:
<DT><A NAME="2:5">2:5</A><DD>Meddle not with them; for I will not give you of their land, no, not so much as a foot breadth; because I have given mount Seir unto Esau <I>for</I> a possession.
<DT><A NAME="2:6">2:6</A><DD>Ye shall buy meat of them for money, that ye may eat; and ye shall also buy water of them for money, that ye may drink.
<DT><A NAME="2:7">2:7</A><DD>For the LORD thy God hath blessed thee in all the works of thy hand: he knoweth thy walking through this great wilderness: these forty years the LORD thy God <I>hath been</I> with thee; thou hast lacked nothing.
<DT><A NAME="2:8">2:8</A><DD>And when we passed by from our brethren the children of Esau, which dwelt in Seir, through the way of the plain from Elath, and from Eziongaber, we turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of Moab.
<DT><A NAME="2:9">2:9</A><DD>And the LORD said unto me, Distress not the Moabites, neither contend with them in battle: for I will not give thee of their land <I>for</I> a possession; because I have given Ar unto the children of Lot <I>for</I> a possession.
<DT><A NAME="2:10">2:10</A><DD>The Emims dwelt therein in times past, a people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakims;
<DT><A NAME="2:11">2:11</A><DD>Which also were accounted giants, as the Anakims; but the Moabites call them Emims.
<DT><A NAME="2:12">2:12</A><DD>The Horims also dwelt in Seir beforetime; but the children of Esau succeeded them, when they had destroyed them from before them, and dwelt in their stead; as Israel did unto the land of his possession, which the LORD gave unto them.
<DT><A NAME="2:13">2:13</A><DD>Now rise up, <I>said I</I>, and get you over the brook Zered. And we went over the brook Zered.
<DT><A NAME="2:14">2:14</A><DD>And the space in which we came from Kadeshbarnea, until we were come over the brook Zered, <I>was</I> thirty and eight years; until all the generation of the men of war were wasted out from among the host, as the LORD sware unto them.
<DT><A NAME="2:15">2:15</A><DD>For indeed the hand of the LORD was against them, to destroy them from among the host, until they were consumed.
<DT><A NAME="2:16">2:16</A><DD>So it came to pass, when all the men of war were consumed and dead from among the people,
<DT><A NAME="2:17">2:17</A><DD>That the LORD spake unto me, saying,
<DT><A NAME="2:18">2:18</A><DD>Thou art to pass over through Ar, the coast of Moab, this day:
<DT><A NAME="2:19">2:19</A><DD>And <I>when</I> thou comest nigh over against the children of Ammon, distress them not, nor meddle with them: for I will not give thee of the land of the children of Ammon <I>any</I> possession; because I have given it unto the children of Lot <I>for</I> a possession.
<DT><A NAME="2:20">2:20</A><DD>(That also was accounted a land of giants: giants dwelt therein in old time; and the Ammonites call them Zamzummims;
<DT><A NAME="2:21">2:21</A><DD>A people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakims; but the LORD destroyed them before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their stead:
<DT><A NAME="2:22">2:22</A><DD>As he did to the children of Esau, which dwelt in Seir, when he destroyed the Horims from before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their stead even unto this day:
<DT><A NAME="2:23">2:23</A><DD>And the Avims which dwelt in Hazerim, <I>even</I> unto Azzah, the Caphtorims, which came forth out of Caphtor, destroyed them, and dwelt in their stead.)
<DT><A NAME="2:24">2:24</A><DD>Rise ye up, take your journey, and pass over the river Arnon: behold, I have given into thine hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land: begin to possess <I>it</I>, and contend with him in battle.
<DT><A NAME="2:25">2:25</A><DD>This day will I begin to put the dread of thee and the fear of thee upon the nations <I>that are</I> under the whole heaven, who shall hear report of thee, and shall tremble, and be in anguish because of thee.
<DT><A NAME="2:26">2:26</A><DD>And I sent messengers out of the wilderness of Kedemoth unto Sihon king of Heshbon with words of peace, saying,
<DT><A NAME="2:27">2:27</A><DD>Let me pass through thy land: I will go along by the high way, I will neither turn unto the right hand nor to the left.
<DT><A NAME="2:28">2:28</A><DD>Thou shalt sell me meat for money, that I may eat; and give me water for money, that I may drink: only I will pass through on my feet;
<DT><A NAME="2:29">2:29</A><DD>(As the children of Esau which dwell in Seir, and the Moabites which dwell in Ar, did unto me;) until I shall pass over Jordan into the land which the LORD our God giveth us.
<DT><A NAME="2:30">2:30</A><DD>But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him: for the LORD thy God hardened his spirit, and made his heart obstinate, that he might deliver him into thy hand, as <I>appeareth</I> this day.
<DT><A NAME="2:31">2:31</A><DD>And the LORD said unto me, Behold, I have begun to give Sihon and his land before thee: begin to possess, that thou mayest inherit his land.
<DT><A NAME="2:32">2:32</A><DD>Then Sihon came out against us, he and all his people, to fight at Jahaz.
<DT><A NAME="2:33">2:33</A><DD>And the LORD our God delivered him before us; and we smote him, and his sons, and all his people.
<DT><A NAME="2:34">2:34</A><DD>And we took all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyed the men, and the women, and the little ones, of every city, we left none to remain:
<DT><A NAME="2:35">2:35</A><DD>Only the cattle we took for a prey unto ourselves, and the spoil of the cities which we took.
<DT><A NAME="2:36">2:36</A><DD>From Aroer, which <I>is</I> by the brink of the river of Arnon, and <I>from</I> the city that <I>is</I> by the river, even unto Gilead, there was not one city too strong for us: the LORD our God delivered all unto us:
<DT><A NAME="2:37">2:37</A><DD>Only unto the land of the children of Ammon thou camest not, <I>nor</I> unto any place of the river Jabbok, nor unto the cities in the mountains, nor unto whatsoever the LORD our God forbad us.
</DL></DIV><H2>Chapter 3</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="3:1">3:1</A><DD>Then we turned, and went up the way to Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei.
<DT><A NAME="3:2">3:2</A><DD>And the LORD said unto me, Fear him not: for I will deliver him, and all his people, and his land, into thy hand; and thou shalt do unto him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites, which dwelt at Heshbon.
<DT><A NAME="3:3">3:3</A><DD>So the LORD our God delivered into our hands Og also, the king of Bashan, and all his people: and we smote him until none was left to him remaining.
<DT><A NAME="3:4">3:4</A><DD>And we took all his cities at that time, there was not a city which we took not from them, threescore cities, all the region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan.
<DT><A NAME="3:5">3:5</A><DD>All these cities <I>were</I> fenced with high walls, gates, and bars; beside unwalled towns a great many.
<DT><A NAME="3:6">3:6</A><DD>And we utterly destroyed them, as we did unto Sihon king of Heshbon, utterly destroying the men, women, and children, of every city.
<DT><A NAME="3:7">3:7</A><DD>But all the cattle, and the spoil of the cities, we took for a prey to ourselves.
<DT><A NAME="3:8">3:8</A><DD>And we took at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites the land that <I>was</I> on this side Jordan, from the river of Arnon unto mount Hermon;
<DT><A NAME="3:9">3:9</A><DD>(<I>Which</I> Hermon the Sidonians call Sirion; and the Amorites call it Shenir;)
<DT><A NAME="3:10">3:10</A><DD>All the cities of the plain, and all Gilead, and all Bashan, unto Salchah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan.
<DT><A NAME="3:11">3:11</A><DD>For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of giants; behold, his bedstead <I>was</I> a bedstead of iron; <I>is</I> it not in Rabbath of the children of Ammon? nine cubits <I>was</I> the length thereof, and four cubits the breadth of it, after the cubit of a man.
<DT><A NAME="3:12">3:12</A><DD>And this land, <I>which</I> we possessed at that time, from Aroer, which <I>is</I> by the river Arnon, and half mount Gilead, and the cities thereof, gave I unto the Reubenites and to the Gadites.
<DT><A NAME="3:13">3:13</A><DD>And the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, <I>being</I> the kingdom of Og, gave I unto the half tribe of Manasseh; all the region of Argob, with all Bashan, which was called the land of giants.
<DT><A NAME="3:14">3:14</A><DD>Jair the son of Manasseh took all the country of Argob unto the coasts of Geshuri and Maachathi; and called them after his own name, Bashanhavothjair, unto this day.
<DT><A NAME="3:15">3:15</A><DD>And I gave Gilead unto Machir.
<DT><A NAME="3:16">3:16</A><DD>And unto the Reubenites and unto the Gadites I gave from Gilead even unto the river Arnon half the valley, and the border even unto the river Jabbok, <I>which is</I> the border of the children of Ammon;
<DT><A NAME="3:17">3:17</A><DD>The plain also, and Jordan, and the coast <I>thereof</I>, from Chinnereth even unto the sea of the plain, <I>even</I> the salt sea, under Ashdothpisgah eastward.
<DT><A NAME="3:18">3:18</A><DD>And I commanded you at that time, saying, The LORD your God hath given you this land to possess it: ye shall pass over armed before your brethren the children of Israel, all <I>that are</I> meet for the war.
<DT><A NAME="3:19">3:19</A><DD>But your wives, and your little ones, and your cattle, (<I>for</I> I know that ye have much cattle,) shall abide in your cities which I have given you;
<DT><A NAME="3:20">3:20</A><DD>Until the LORD have given rest unto your brethren, as well as unto you, and <I>until</I> they also possess the land which the LORD your God hath given them beyond Jordan: and <I>then</I> shall ye return every man unto his possession, which I have given you.
<DT><A NAME="3:21">3:21</A><DD>And I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, Thine eyes have seen all that the LORD your God hath done unto these two kings: so shall the LORD do unto all the kingdoms whither thou passest.

<DT><A NAME="9:4">9:4</A><DD>Speak not thou in thine heart, after that the LORD thy God hath cast them out from before thee, saying, For my righteousness the LORD hath brought me in to possess this land: but for the wickedness of these nations the LORD doth drive them out from before thee.

<DT><A NAME="9:6">9:6</A><DD>Understand therefore, that the LORD thy God giveth thee not this good land to possess it for thy righteousness; for thou <I>art</I> a stiffnecked people.
<DT><A NAME="9:7">9:7</A><DD>Remember, <I>and</I> forget not, how thou provokedst the LORD thy God to wrath in the wilderness: from the day that thou didst depart out of the land of Egypt, until ye came unto this place, ye have been rebellious against the LORD.
<DT><A NAME="9:8">9:8</A><DD>Also in Horeb ye provoked the LORD to wrath, so that the LORD was angry with you to have destroyed you.
<DT><A NAME="9:9">9:9</A><DD>When I was gone up into the mount to receive the tables of stone, <I>even</I> the tables of the covenant which the LORD made with you, then I abode in the mount forty days and forty nights, I neither did eat bread nor drink water:
<DT><A NAME="9:10">9:10</A><DD>And the LORD delivered unto me two tables of stone written with the finger of God; and on them <I>was written</I> according to all the words, which the LORD spake with you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly.
<DT><A NAME="9:11">9:11</A><DD>And it came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights, <I>that</I> the LORD gave me the two tables of stone, <I>even</I> the tables of the covenant.
<DT><A NAME="9:12">9:12</A><DD>And the LORD said unto me, Arise, get thee down quickly from hence; for thy people which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt have corrupted <I>themselves</I>; they are quickly turned aside out of the way which I commanded them; they have made them a molten image.
<DT><A NAME="9:13">9:13</A><DD>Furthermore the LORD spake unto me, saying, I have seen this people, and, behold, it <I>is</I> a stiffnecked people:
<DT><A NAME="9:14">9:14</A><DD>Let me alone, that I may destroy them, and blot out their name from under heaven: and I will make of thee a nation mightier and greater than they.
<DT><A NAME="9:15">9:15</A><DD>So I turned and came down from the mount, and the mount burned with fire: and the two tables of the covenant <I>were</I> in my two hands.
<DT><A NAME="9:16">9:16</A><DD>And I looked, and, behold, ye had sinned against the LORD your God, <I>and</I> had made you a molten calf: ye had turned aside quickly out of the way which the LORD had commanded you.
<DT><A NAME="9:17">9:17</A><DD>And I took the two tables, and cast them out of my two hands, and brake them before your eyes.
<DT><A NAME="9:18">9:18</A><DD>And I fell down before the LORD, as at the first, forty days and forty nights: I did neither eat bread, nor drink water, because of all your sins which ye sinned, in doing wickedly in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger.
<DT><A NAME="9:19">9:19</A><DD>For I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure, wherewith the LORD was wroth against you to destroy you. But the LORD hearkened unto me at that time also.
<DT><A NAME="9:20">9:20</A><DD>And the LORD was very angry with Aaron to have destroyed him: and I prayed for Aaron also the same time.
<DT><A NAME="9:21">9:21</A><DD>And I took your sin, the calf which ye had made, and burnt it with fire, and stamped it, <I>and</I> ground <I>it</I> very small, <I>even</I> until it was as small as dust: and I cast the dust thereof into the brook that descended out of the mount.
<DT><A NAME="9:22">9:22</A><DD>And at Taberah, and at Massah, and at Kibrothhattaavah, ye provoked the LORD to wrath.
<DT><A NAME="9:23">9:23</A><DD>Likewise when the LORD sent you from Kadeshbarnea, saying, Go up and possess the land which I have given you; then ye rebelled against the commandment of the LORD your God, and ye believed him not, nor hearkened to his voice.
<DT><A NAME="9:24">9:24</A><DD>Ye have been rebellious against the LORD from the day that I knew you.
<DT><A NAME="9:25">9:25</A><DD>Thus I fell down before the LORD forty days and forty nights, as I fell down <I>at the first</I>; because the LORD had said he would destroy you.
<DT><A NAME="9:26">9:26</A><DD>I prayed therefore unto the LORD, and said, O Lord GOD, destroy not thy people and thine inheritance, which thou hast redeemed through thy greatness, which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand.
<DT><A NAME="9:27">9:27</A><DD>Remember thy servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; look not unto the stubbornness of this people, nor to their wickedness, nor to their sin:

<DT><A NAME="31:27">31:27</A><DD>For I know thy rebellion, and thy stiff neck: behold, while I am yet alive with you this day, ye have been rebellious against the LORD; and how much more after my death?
<DT><A NAME="31:28">31:28</A><DD>Gather unto me all the elders of your tribes, and your officers, that I may speak these words in their ears, and call heaven and earth to record against them.
<DT><A NAME="31:29">31:29</A><DD>For I know that after my death ye will utterly corrupt <I>yourselves</I>, and turn aside from the way which I have commanded you; and evil will befall you in the latter days; because ye will do evil in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger through the work of your hands.

<DT><A NAME="32:2">32:2</A><DD>My doctrine shall drop as the rain, my speech shall distil as the dew, as the small rain upon the tender herb, and as the showers upon the grass:
<DT><A NAME="32:3">32:3</A><DD>Because I will publish the name of the LORD: ascribe ye greatness unto our God.
<DT><A NAME="32:4">32:4</A><DD><I>He is</I> the Rock, his work <I>is</I> perfect: for all his ways <I>are</I> judgment: a God of truth and without iniquity, just and right <I>is</I> he.
<DT><A NAME="32:5">32:5</A><DD>They have corrupted themselves, their spot <I>is</I> not <I>the spot</I> of his children: <I>they are</I> a perverse and crooked generation.
<DT><A NAME="32:6">32:6</A><DD>Do ye thus requite the LORD, O foolish people and unwise? <I>is</I> not he thy father <I>that</I> hath bought thee? hath he not made thee, and established thee?
<DT><A NAME="32:7">32:7</A><DD>Remember the days of old, consider the years of many generations: ask thy father, and he will shew thee; thy elders, and they will tell thee.
<DT><A NAME="32:8">32:8</A><DD>When the most High divided to the nations their inheritance, when he separated the sons of Adam, he set the bounds of the people according to the number of the children of Israel.
<DT><A NAME="32:9">32:9</A><DD>For the LORD'S portion <I>is</I> his people; Jacob <I>is</I> the lot of his inheritance.
<DT><A NAME="32:10">32:10</A><DD>He found him in a desert land, and in the waste howling wilderness; he led him about, he instructed him, he kept him as the apple of his eye.
<DT><A NAME="32:11">32:11</A><DD>As an eagle stirreth up her nest, fluttereth over her young, spreadeth abroad her wings, taketh them, beareth them on her wings:

<DT><A NAME="32:13">32:13</A><DD>He made him ride on the high places of the earth, that he might eat the increase of the fields; and he made him to suck honey out of the rock, and oil out of the flinty rock;
<DT><A NAME="32:14">32:14</A><DD>Butter of kine, and milk of sheep, with fat of lambs, and rams of the breed of Bashan, and goats, with the fat of kidneys of wheat; and thou didst drink the pure blood of the grape.

<DT><A NAME="32:20">32:20</A><DD>And he said, I will hide my face from them, I will see what their end <I>shall be</I>: for they <I>are</I> a very froward generation, children in whom <I>is</I> no faith.
<DT><A NAME="32:21">32:21</A><DD>They have moved me to jealousy with <I>that which is</I> not God; they have provoked me to anger with their vanities: and I will move them to jealousy with <I>those which are</I> not a people; I will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation.
<DT><A NAME="32:22">32:22</A><DD>For a fire is kindled in mine anger, and shall burn unto the lowest hell, and shall consume the earth with her increase, and set on fire the foundations of the mountains.
<DT><A NAME="32:23">32:23</A><DD>I will heap mischiefs upon them; I will spend mine arrows upon them.
<DT><A NAME="32:24">32:24</A><DD><I>They shall be</I> burnt with hunger, and devoured with burning heat, and with bitter destruction: I will also send the teeth of beasts upon them, with the poison of serpents of the dust.

<DT><A NAME="32:26">32:26</A><DD>I said, I would scatter them into corners, I would make the remembrance of them to cease from among men:

<DT><A NAME="32:31">32:31</A><DD>For their rock <I>is</I> not as our Rock, even our enemies themselves <I>being</I> judges.
<DT><A NAME="32:32">32:32</A><DD>For their vine <I>is</I> of the vine of Sodom, and of the fields of Gomorrah: their grapes <I>are</I> grapes of gall, their clusters <I>are</I> bitter:
<DT><A NAME="32:33">32:33</A><DD>Their wine <I>is</I> the poison of dragons, and the cruel venom of asps.

<DT><A NAME="32:35">32:35</A><DD>To me <I>belongeth</I> vengeance, and recompence; their foot shall slide in <I>due</I> time: for the day of their calamity <I>is</I> at hand, and the things that shall come upon them make haste.
<DT><A NAME="32:36">32:36</A><DD>For the LORD shall judge his people, and repent himself for his servants, when he seeth that <I>their</I> power is gone, and <I>there is</I> none shut up, or left.
<DT><A NAME="32:37">32:37</A><DD>And he shall say, Where <I>are</I> their gods, <I>their</I> rock in whom they trusted,
<DT><A NAME="32:38">32:38</A><DD>Which did eat the fat of their sacrifices, <I>and</I> drank the wine of their drink offerings? let them rise up and help you, <I>and</I> be your protection.
<DT><A NAME="32:39">32:39</A><DD>See now that I, <I>even</I> I, <I>am</I> he, and <I>there is</I> no god with me: I kill, and I make alive; I wound, and I heal: neither <I>is there any</I> that can deliver out of my hand.
<DT><A NAME="32:40">32:40</A><DD>For I lift up my hand to heaven, and say, I live for ever.
<DT><A NAME="32:41">32:41</A><DD>If I whet my glittering sword, and mine hand take hold on judgment; I will render vengeance to mine enemies, and will reward them that hate me.
<DT><A NAME="32:42">32:42</A><DD>I will make mine arrows drunk with blood, and my sword shall devour flesh; <I>and that</I> with the blood of the slain and of the captives, from the beginning of revenges upon the enemy.
<DT><A NAME="32:43">32:43</A><DD>Rejoice, O ye nations, <I>with</I> his people: for he will avenge the blood of his servants, and will render vengeance to his adversaries, and will be merciful unto his land, <I>and</I> to his people.
<DT><A NAME="32:44">32:44</A><DD>And Moses came and spake all the words of this song in the ears of the people, he, and Hoshea the son of Nun.
<DT><A NAME="32:45">32:45</A><DD>And Moses made an end of speaking all these words to all Israel:
<DT><A NAME="32:46">32:46</A><DD>And he said unto them, Set your hearts unto all the words which I testify among you this day, which ye shall command your children to observe to do, all the words of this law.
<DT><A NAME="32:47">32:47</A><DD>For it <I>is</I> not a vain thing for you; because it <I>is</I> your life: and through this thing ye shall prolong <I>your</I> days in the land, whither ye go over Jordan to possess it.
<DT><A NAME="32:48">32:48</A><DD>And the LORD spake unto Moses that selfsame day, saying,
<DT><A NAME="32:49">32:49</A><DD>Get thee up into this mountain Abarim, <I>unto</I> mount Nebo, which <I>is</I> in the land of Moab, that <I>is</I> over against Jericho; and behold the land of Canaan, which I give unto the children of Israel for a possession:
<DT><A NAME="32:50">32:50</A><DD>And die in the mount whither thou goest up, and be gathered unto thy people; as Aaron thy brother died in mount Hor, and was gathered unto his people:
<DT><A NAME="32:51">32:51</A><DD>Because ye trespassed against me among the children of Israel at the waters of Meribah-Kadesh, in the wilderness of Zin; because ye sanctified me not in the midst of the children of Israel.
<DT><A NAME="32:52">32:52</A><DD>Yet thou shalt see the land before <I>thee</I>; but thou shalt not go thither unto the land which I give the children of Israel.
