<H2>Chapter 1</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="1:1">1:1</A><DD>Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, according to the promise of life which is in Christ Jesus,
<DT><A NAME="1:2">1:2</A><DD>To Timothy, <I>my</I> dearly beloved son: Grace, mercy, <I>and</I> peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.
<DT><A NAME="1:3">1:3</A><DD>I thank God, whom I serve from <I>my</I> forefathers with pure conscience, that without ceasing I have remembrance of thee in my prayers night and day;
<DT><A NAME="1:4">1:4</A><DD>Greatly desiring to see thee, being mindful of thy tears, that I may be filled with joy;
<DT><A NAME="1:5">1:5</A><DD>When I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee, which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and thy mother Eunice; and I am persuaded that in thee also.
<DT><A NAME="1:6">1:6</A><DD>Wherefore I put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of God, which is in thee by the putting on of my hands.
<DT><A NAME="1:7">1:7</A><DD>For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind.
<DT><A NAME="1:8">1:8</A><DD>Be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner: but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the gospel according to the power of God;
<DT><A NAME="1:9">1:9</A><DD>Who hath saved us, and called <I>us</I> with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began,
<DT><A NAME="1:10">1:10</A><DD>But is now made manifest by the appearing of our Saviour Jesus Christ, who hath abolished death, and hath brought life and immortality to light through the gospel:
<DT><A NAME="1:11">1:11</A><DD>Whereunto I am appointed a preacher, and an apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles.
<DT><A NAME="1:12">1:12</A><DD>For the which cause I also suffer these things: nevertheless I am not ashamed: for I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day.
<DT><A NAME="1:13">1:13</A><DD>Hold fast the form of sound words, which thou hast heard of me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.
<DT><A NAME="1:14">1:14</A><DD>That good thing which was committed unto thee keep by the Holy Ghost which dwelleth in us.
<DT><A NAME="1:15">1:15</A><DD>This thou knowest, that all they which are in Asia be turned away from me; of whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes.
<DT><A NAME="1:16">1:16</A><DD>The Lord give mercy unto the house of Onesiphorus; for he oft refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain:
<DT><A NAME="1:17">1:17</A><DD>But, when he was in Rome, he sought me out very diligently, and found <I>me</I>.
<DT><A NAME="1:18">1:18</A><DD>The Lord grant unto him that he may find mercy of the Lord in that day: and in how many things he ministered unto me at Ephesus, thou knowest very well.
</DL></DIV><H2>Chapter 2</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="2:1">2:1</A><DD>Thou therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.
<DT><A NAME="2:2">2:2</A><DD>And the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also.
<DT><A NAME="2:3">2:3</A><DD>Thou therefore endure hardness, as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.
<DT><A NAME="2:4">2:4</A><DD>No man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of <I>this</I> life; that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier.
<DT><A NAME="2:5">2:5</A><DD>And if a man also strive for masteries, <I>yet</I> is he not crowned, except he strive lawfully.
<DT><A NAME="2:6">2:6</A><DD>The husbandman that laboureth must be first partaker of the fruits.
<DT><A NAME="2:7">2:7</A><DD>Consider what I say; and the Lord give thee understanding in all things.
<DT><A NAME="2:8">2:8</A><DD>Remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David was raised from the dead according to my gospel:
<DT><A NAME="2:9">2:9</A><DD>Wherein I suffer trouble, as an evil doer, <I>even</I> unto bonds; but the word of God is not bound.
<DT><A NAME="2:10">2:10</A><DD>Therefore I endure all things for the elect's sakes, that they may also obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.
<DT><A NAME="2:11">2:11</A><DD><I>It is</I> a faithful saying: For if we be dead with <I>him</I>, we shall also live with <I>him</I>:
<DT><A NAME="2:12">2:12</A><DD>If we suffer, we shall also reign with <I>him</I>: if we deny <I>him</I>, he also will deny us:
<DT><A NAME="2:13">2:13</A><DD>If we believe not, <I>yet</I> he abideth faithful: he cannot deny himself.
<DT><A NAME="2:14">2:14</A><DD>Of these things put <I>them</I> in remembrance, charging <I>them</I> before the Lord that they strive not about words to no profit, <I>but</I> to the subverting of the hearers.
<DT><A NAME="2:15">2:15</A><DD>Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.
<DT><A NAME="2:16">2:16</A><DD>But shun profane <I>and</I> vain babblings: for they will increase unto more ungodliness.
<DT><A NAME="2:17">2:17</A><DD>And their word will eat as doth a canker: of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus;
<DT><A NAME="2:18">2:18</A><DD>Who concerning the truth have erred, saying that the resurrection is past already; and overthrow the faith of some.
<DT><A NAME="2:19">2:19</A><DD>Nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are his. And, Let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity.
<DT><A NAME="2:20">2:20</A><DD>But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some to honour, and some to dishonour.
<DT><A NAME="2:21">2:21</A><DD>If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honour, sanctified, and meet for the master's use, <I>and</I> prepared unto every good work.
<DT><A NAME="2:22">2:22</A><DD>Flee also youthful lusts: but follow righteousness, faith, charity, peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart.
<DT><A NAME="2:23">2:23</A><DD>But foolish and unlearned questions avoid, knowing that they do gender strifes.
<DT><A NAME="2:24">2:24</A><DD>And the servant of the Lord must not strive; but be gentle unto all <I>men</I>, apt to teach, patient,
<DT><A NAME="2:25">2:25</A><DD>In meekness instructing those that oppose themselves; if God peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth;
<DT><A NAME="2:26">2:26</A><DD>And <I>that</I> they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil, who are taken captive by him at his will.
</DL></DIV><H2>Chapter 3</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="3:1">3:1</A><DD>This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.
<DT><A NAME="3:2">3:2</A><DD>For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,
<DT><A NAME="3:3">3:3</A><DD>Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good,
<DT><A NAME="3:4">3:4</A><DD>Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God;
<DT><A NAME="3:5">3:5</A><DD>Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away.
<DT><A NAME="3:6">3:6</A><DD>For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead captive silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts,
<DT><A NAME="3:7">3:7</A><DD>Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.
<DT><A NAME="3:8">3:8</A><DD>Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also resist the truth: men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith.
<DT><A NAME="3:9">3:9</A><DD>But they shall proceed no further: for their folly shall be manifest unto all <I>men</I>, as theirs also was.
<DT><A NAME="3:10">3:10</A><DD>But thou hast fully known my doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith, longsuffering, charity, patience,
<DT><A NAME="3:11">3:11</A><DD>Persecutions, afflictions, which came unto me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra; what persecutions I endured: but out of <I>them</I> all the Lord delivered me.
<DT><A NAME="3:12">3:12</A><DD>Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.
<DT><A NAME="3:13">3:13</A><DD>But evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving, and being deceived.
<DT><A NAME="3:14">3:14</A><DD>But continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast been assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned <I>them</I>;
<DT><A NAME="3:15">3:15</A><DD>And that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.
<DT><A NAME="3:16">3:16</A><DD>All scripture <I>is</I> given by inspiration of God, and <I>is</I> profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness:
<DT><A NAME="3:17">3:17</A><DD>That the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works.
</DL></DIV><H2>Chapter 4</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="4:1">4:1</A><DD>I charge <I>thee</I> therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom;
<DT><A NAME="4:2">4:2</A><DD>Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine.
<DT><A NAME="4:3">4:3</A><DD>For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears;
<DT><A NAME="4:4">4:4</A><DD>And they shall turn away <I>their</I> ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables.
<DT><A NAME="4:5">4:5</A><DD>But watch thou in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, make full proof of thy ministry.
<DT><A NAME="4:6">4:6</A><DD>For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand.
<DT><A NAME="4:7">4:7</A><DD>I have fought a good fight, I have finished <I>my</I> course, I have kept the faith:
<DT><A NAME="4:8">4:8</A><DD>Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day: and not to me only, but unto all them also that love his appearing.
<DT><A NAME="4:9">4:9</A><DD>Do thy diligence to come shortly unto me:
<DT><A NAME="4:10">4:10</A><DD>For Demas hath forsaken me, having loved this present world, and is departed unto Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, Titus unto Dalmatia.
<DT><A NAME="4:11">4:11</A><DD>Only Luke is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with thee: for he is profitable to me for the ministry.
<DT><A NAME="4:12">4:12</A><DD>And Tychicus have I sent to Ephesus.
<DT><A NAME="4:13">4:13</A><DD>The cloke that I left at Troas with Carpus, when thou comest, bring <I>with thee</I>, and the books, <I>but</I> especially the parchments.
<DT><A NAME="4:14">4:14</A><DD>Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil: the Lord reward him according to his works:
<DT><A NAME="4:15">4:15</A><DD>Of whom be thou ware also; for he hath greatly withstood our words.
<DT><A NAME="4:16">4:16</A><DD>At my first answer no man stood with me, but all <I>men</I> forsook me: <I>I pray God</I> that it may not be laid to their charge.
<DT><A NAME="4:17">4:17</A><DD>Notwithstanding the Lord stood with me, and strengthened me; that by me the preaching might be fully known, and <I>that</I> all the Gentiles might hear: and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.
<DT><A NAME="4:18">4:18</A><DD>And the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work, and will preserve <I>me</I> unto his heavenly kingdom: to whom <I>be</I> glory for ever and ever. Amen.
<DT><A NAME="4:19">4:19</A><DD>Salute Prisca and Aquila, and the household of Onesiphorus.
<DT><A NAME="4:20">4:20</A><DD>Erastus abode at Corinth: but Trophimus have I left at Miletum sick.
<DT><A NAME="4:21">4:21</A><DD>Do thy diligence to come before winter. Eubulus greeteth thee, and Pudens, and Linus, and Claudia, and all the brethren.
<DT><A NAME="4:22">4:22</A><DD>The Lord Jesus Christ <I>be</I> with thy spirit. Grace <I>be</I> with you. Amen.
