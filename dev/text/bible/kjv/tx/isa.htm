<DT><A NAME="1:1">1:1</A><DD>The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, <I>and</I> Hezekiah, kings of Judah.
<DT><A NAME="1:2">1:2</A><DD>Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth: for the LORD hath spoken, I have nourished and brought up children, and they have rebelled against me.
<DT><A NAME="1:3">1:3</A><DD>The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master's crib: <I>but</I> Israel doth not know, my people doth not consider.
<DT><A NAME="1:4">1:4</A><DD>Ah sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a seed of evildoers, children that are corrupters: they have forsaken the LORD, they have provoked the Holy One of Israel unto anger, they are gone away backward.
<DT><A NAME="1:5">1:5</A><DD>Why should ye be stricken any more? ye will revolt more and more: the whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint.
<DT><A NAME="1:6">1:6</A><DD>From the sole of the foot even unto the head <I>there is</I> no soundness in it; <I>but</I> wounds, and bruises, and putrifying sores: they have not been closed, neither bound up, neither mollified with ointment.
<DT><A NAME="1:7">1:7</A><DD>Your country <I>is</I> desolate, your cities <I>are</I> burned with fire: your land, strangers devour it in your presence, and <I>it is</I> desolate, as overthrown by strangers.
<DT><A NAME="1:8">1:8</A><DD>And the daughter of Zion is left as a cottage in a vineyard, as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers, as a besieged city.
<DT><A NAME="1:9">1:9</A><DD>Except the LORD of hosts had left unto us a very small remnant, we should have been as Sodom, <I>and</I> we should have been like unto Gomorrah.
<DT><A NAME="1:10">1:10</A><DD>Hear the word of the LORD, ye rulers of Sodom; give ear unto the law of our God, ye people of Gomorrah.
<DT><A NAME="1:11">1:11</A><DD>To what purpose <I>is</I> the multitude of your sacrifices unto me? saith the LORD: I am full of the burnt offerings of rams, and the fat of fed beasts; and I delight not in the blood of bullocks, or of lambs, or of he goats.
<DT><A NAME="1:12">1:12</A><DD>When ye come to appear before me, who hath required this at your hand, to tread my courts?
<DT><A NAME="1:13">1:13</A><DD>Bring no more vain oblations; incense is an abomination unto me; the new moons and sabbaths, the calling of assemblies, I cannot away with; <I>it is</I> iniquity, even the solemn meeting.
<DT><A NAME="1:14">1:14</A><DD>Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth: they are a trouble unto me; I am weary to bear <I>them</I>.
<DT><A NAME="1:15">1:15</A><DD>And when ye spread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes from you: yea, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear: your hands are full of blood.
<DT><A NAME="1:16">1:16</A><DD>Wash you, make you clean; put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes; cease to do evil;
<DT><A NAME="1:17">1:17</A><DD>Learn to do well; seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the widow.
<DT><A NAME="1:18">1:18</A><DD>Come now, and let us reason together, saith the LORD: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.
<DT><A NAME="1:19">1:19</A><DD>If ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land:
<DT><A NAME="1:20">1:20</A><DD>But if ye refuse and rebel, ye shall be devoured with the sword: for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken <I>it</I>.
<DT><A NAME="1:21">1:21</A><DD>How is the faithful city become an harlot! it was full of judgment; righteousness lodged in it; but now murderers.
<DT><A NAME="1:22">1:22</A><DD>Thy silver is become dross, thy wine mixed with water:
<DT><A NAME="1:23">1:23</A><DD>Thy princes <I>are</I> rebellious, and companions of thieves: every one loveth gifts, and followeth after rewards: they judge not the fatherless, neither doth the cause of the widow come unto them.
<DT><A NAME="1:24">1:24</A><DD>Therefore saith the Lord, the LORD of hosts, the mighty One of Israel, Ah, I will ease me of mine adversaries, and avenge me of mine enemies:
<DT><A NAME="1:25">1:25</A><DD>And I will turn my hand upon thee, and purely purge away thy dross, and take away all thy tin:
<DT><A NAME="1:26">1:26</A><DD>And I will restore thy judges as at the first, and thy counsellors as at the beginning: afterward thou shalt be called, The city of righteousness, the faithful city.
<DT><A NAME="1:27">1:27</A><DD>Zion shall be redeemed with judgment, and her converts with righteousness.
<DT><A NAME="1:28">1:28</A><DD>And the destruction of the transgressors and of the sinners <I>shall be</I> together, and they that forsake the LORD shall be consumed.
<DT><A NAME="1:29">1:29</A><DD>For they shall be ashamed of the oaks which ye have desired, and ye shall be confounded for the gardens that ye have chosen.
<DT><A NAME="1:30">1:30</A><DD>For ye shall be as an oak whose leaf fadeth, and as a garden that hath no water.
<DT><A NAME="1:31">1:31</A><DD>And the strong shall be as tow, and the maker of it as a spark, and they shall both burn together, and none shall quench <I>them</I>.

<DT><A NAME="2:1">2:1</A><DD>The word that Isaiah the son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem.
<DT><A NAME="2:2">2:2</A><DD>And it shall come to pass in the last days, <I>that</I> the mountain of the LORD'S house shall be established in the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills; and all nations shall flow unto it.
<DT><A NAME="2:3">2:3</A><DD>And many people shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.
<DT><A NAME="2:4">2:4</A><DD>And he shall judge among the nations, and shall rebuke many people: and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruninghooks: nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.
<DT><A NAME="2:5">2:5</A><DD>O house of Jacob, come ye, and let us walk in the light of the LORD.
<DT><A NAME="2:6">2:6</A><DD>Therefore thou hast forsaken thy people the house of Jacob, because they be replenished from the east, and <I>are</I> soothsayers like the Philistines, and they please themselves in the children of strangers.
<DT><A NAME="2:7">2:7</A><DD>Their land also is full of silver and gold, neither <I>is there any</I> end of their treasures; their land is also full of horses, neither <I>is there any</I> end of their chariots:
<DT><A NAME="2:8">2:8</A><DD>Their land also is full of idols; they worship the work of their own hands, that which their own fingers have made:
<DT><A NAME="2:9">2:9</A><DD>And the mean man boweth down, and the great man humbleth himself: therefore forgive them not.
<DT><A NAME="2:10">2:10</A><DD>Enter into the rock, and hide thee in the dust, for fear of the LORD, and for the glory of his majesty.
<DT><A NAME="2:11">2:11</A><DD>The lofty looks of man shall be humbled, and the haughtiness of men shall be bowed down, and the LORD alone shall be exalted in that day.
<DT><A NAME="2:12">2:12</A><DD>For the day of the LORD of hosts <I>shall be</I> upon every <I>one that is</I> proud and lofty, and upon every <I>one that is</I> lifted up; and he shall be brought low:
<DT><A NAME="2:13">2:13</A><DD>And upon all the cedars of Lebanon, <I>that are</I> high and lifted up, and upon all the oaks of Bashan,
<DT><A NAME="2:14">2:14</A><DD>And upon all the high mountains, and upon all the hills <I>that are</I> lifted up,
<DT><A NAME="2:15">2:15</A><DD>And upon every high tower, and upon every fenced wall,
<DT><A NAME="2:16">2:16</A><DD>And upon all the ships of Tarshish, and upon all pleasant pictures.
<DT><A NAME="2:17">2:17</A><DD>And the loftiness of man shall be bowed down, and the haughtiness of men shall be made low: and the LORD alone shall be exalted in that day.
<DT><A NAME="2:18">2:18</A><DD>And the idols he shall utterly abolish.
<DT><A NAME="2:19">2:19</A><DD>And they shall go into the holes of the rocks, and into the caves of the earth, for fear of the LORD, and for the glory of his majesty, when he ariseth to shake terribly the earth.
<DT><A NAME="2:20">2:20</A><DD>In that day a man shall cast his idols of silver, and his idols of gold, which they made <I>each one</I> for himself to worship, to the moles and to the bats;
<DT><A NAME="2:21">2:21</A><DD>To go into the clefts of the rocks, and into the tops of the ragged rocks, for fear of the LORD, and for the glory of his majesty, when he ariseth to shake terribly the earth.

</DL></DIV><H2>Chapter 3</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="3:1">3:1</A><DD>For, behold, the Lord, the LORD of hosts, doth take away from Jerusalem and from Judah the stay and the staff, the whole stay of bread, and the whole stay of water,
<DT><A NAME="3:2">3:2</A><DD>The mighty man, and the man of war, the judge, and the prophet, and the prudent, and the ancient,

<DT><A NAME="3:4">3:4</A><DD>And I will give children <I>to be</I> their princes, and babes shall rule over them.
<DT><A NAME="3:5">3:5</A><DD>And the people shall be oppressed, every one by another, and every one by his neighbour: the child shall behave himself proudly against the ancient, and the base against the honourable.
<DT><A NAME="3:6">3:6</A><DD>When a man shall take hold of his brother of the house of his father, <I>saying</I>, Thou hast clothing, be thou our ruler, and <I>let</I> this ruin <I>be</I> under thy hand:
<DT><A NAME="3:7">3:7</A><DD>In that day shall he swear, saying, I will not be an healer; for in my house <I>is</I> neither bread nor clothing: make me not a ruler of the people.
<DT><A NAME="3:8">3:8</A><DD>For Jerusalem is ruined, and Judah is fallen: because their tongue and their doings <I>are</I> against the LORD, to provoke the eyes of his glory.
<DT><A NAME="3:9">3:9</A><DD>The shew of their countenance doth witness against them; and they declare their sin as Sodom, they hide <I>it</I> not. Woe unto their soul! for they have rewarded evil unto themselves.
<DT><A NAME="3:10">3:10</A><DD>Say ye to the righteous, that <I>it shall be</I> well <I>with him</I>: for they shall eat the fruit of their doings.
<DT><A NAME="3:11">3:11</A><DD>Woe unto the wicked! <I>it shall be</I> ill <I>with him</I>: for the reward of his hands shall be given him.

<DT><A NAME="5:4">5:4</A><DD>What could have been done more to my vineyard, that I have not done in it? wherefore, when I looked that it should bring forth grapes, brought it forth wild grapes?

<DT><A NAME="5:7">5:7</A><DD>For the vineyard of the LORD of hosts <I>is</I> the house of Israel, and the men of Judah his pleasant plant: and he looked for judgment, but behold oppression; for righteousness, but behold a cry.

<DT><A NAME="63:16">63:16</A><DD>Doubtless thou <I>art</I> our father, though Abraham be ignorant of us, and Israel acknowledge us not: thou, O LORD, <I>art</I> our father, our redeemer; thy name <I>is</I> from everlasting.
<DT><A NAME="63:17">63:17</A><DD>O LORD, why hast thou made us to err from thy ways, <I>and</I> hardened our heart from thy fear? Return for thy servants' sake, the tribes of thine inheritance.

<DT><A NAME="65:1">65:1</A><DD>I am sought of <I>them that</I> asked not <I>for me</I>; I am found of <I>them that</I> sought me not: I said, Behold me, behold me, unto a nation <I>that</I> was not called by my name.
<DT><A NAME="65:2">65:2</A><DD>I have spread out my hands all the day unto a rebellious people, which walketh in a way <I>that was</I> not good, after their own thoughts;
<DT><A NAME="65:3">65:3</A><DD>A people that provoketh me to anger continually to my face; that sacrificeth in gardens, and burneth incense upon altars of brick;

<DT><A NAME="65:7">65:7</A><DD>Your iniquities, and the iniquities of your fathers together, saith the LORD, which have burned incense upon the mountains, and blasphemed me upon the hills: therefore will I measure their former work into their bosom.
<DT><A NAME="65:8">65:8</A><DD>Thus saith the LORD, As the new wine is found in the cluster, and <I>one</I> saith, Destroy it not; for a blessing <I>is</I> in it: so will I do for my servants' sakes, that I may not destroy them all.
<DT><A NAME="65:9">65:9</A><DD>And I will bring forth a seed out of Jacob, and out of Judah an inheritor of my mountains: and mine elect shall inherit it, and my servants shall dwell there.
<DT><A NAME="65:10">65:10</A><DD>And Sharon shall be a fold of flocks, and the valley of Achor a place for the herds to lie down in, for my people that have sought me.

<DT><A NAME="65:12">65:12</A><DD>Therefore will I number you to the sword, and ye shall all bow down to the slaughter: because when I called, ye did not answer; when I spake, ye did not hear; but did evil before mine eyes, and did choose <I>that</I> wherein I delighted not.
<DT><A NAME="65:13">65:13</A><DD>Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD, Behold, my servants shall eat, but ye shall be hungry: behold, my servants shall drink, but ye shall be thirsty: behold, my servants shall rejoice, but ye shall be ashamed:

<DT><A NAME="65:15">65:15</A><DD>And ye shall leave your name for a curse unto my chosen: for the Lord GOD shall slay thee, and call his servants by another name:
<DT><A NAME="65:16">65:16</A><DD>That he who blesseth himself in the earth shall bless himself in the God of truth; and he that sweareth in the earth shall swear by the God of truth; because the former troubles are forgotten, and because they are hid from mine eyes.
<DT><A NAME="65:17">65:17</A><DD>For, behold, I create new heavens and a new earth: and the former shall not be remembered, nor come into mind.
<DT><A NAME="65:18">65:18</A><DD>But be ye glad and rejoice for ever <I>in that</I> which I create: for, behold, I create Jerusalem a rejoicing, and her people a joy.
<DT><A NAME="65:19">65:19</A><DD>And I will rejoice in Jerusalem, and joy in my people: and the voice of weeping shall be no more heard in her, nor the voice of crying.
<DT><A NAME="65:20">65:20</A><DD>There shall be no more thence an infant of days, nor an old man that hath not filled his days: for the child shall die an hundred years old; but the sinner <I>being</I> an hundred years old shall be accursed.
<DT><A NAME="65:21">65:21</A><DD>And they shall build houses, and inhabit <I>them</I>; and they shall plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them.
<DT><A NAME="65:22">65:22</A><DD>They shall not build, and another inhabit; they shall not plant, and another eat: for as the days of a tree <I>are</I> the days of my people, and mine elect shall long enjoy the work of their hands.
<DT><A NAME="65:23">65:23</A><DD>They shall not labour in vain, nor bring forth for trouble; for they <I>are</I> the seed of the blessed of the LORD, and their offspring with them.
<DT><A NAME="65:24">65:24</A><DD>And it shall come to pass, that before they call, I will answer; and while they are yet speaking, I will hear.
<DT><A NAME="65:25">65:25</A><DD>The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, and the lion shall eat straw like the bullock: and dust <I>shall be</I> the serpent's meat. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain, saith the LORD.

<DT><A NAME="66:2">66:2</A><DD>For all those <I>things</I> hath mine hand made, and all those <I>things</I> have been, saith the LORD: but to this <I>man</I> will I look, <I>even</I> to <I>him that is</I> poor and of a contrite spirit, and trembleth at my word.
<DT><A NAME="66:3">66:3</A><DD>He that killeth an ox <I>is as if</I> he slew a man; he that sacrificeth a lamb, <I>as if</I> he cut off a dog's neck; he that offereth an oblation, <I>as if he offered</I> swine's blood; he that burneth incense, <I>as if</I> he blessed an idol. Yea, they have chosen their own ways, and their soul delighteth in their abominations.
<DT><A NAME="66:4">66:4</A><DD>I also will choose their delusions, and will bring their fears upon them; because when I called, none did answer; when I spake, they did not hear: but they did evil before mine eyes, and chose <I>that</I> in which I delighted not.
<DT><A NAME="66:5">66:5</A><DD>Hear the word of the LORD, ye that tremble at his word; Your brethren that hated you, that cast you out for my name's sake, said, Let the LORD be glorified: but he shall appear to your joy, and they shall be ashamed.
<DT><A NAME="66:6">66:6</A><DD>A voice of noise from the city, a voice from the temple, a voice of the LORD that rendereth recompence to his enemies.
<DT><A NAME="66:7">66:7</A><DD>Before she travailed, she brought forth; before her pain came, she was delivered of a man child.
<DT><A NAME="66:8">66:8</A><DD>Who hath heard such a thing? who hath seen such things? Shall the earth be made to bring forth in one day? <I>or</I> shall a nation be born at once? for as soon as Zion travailed, she brought forth her children.
<DT><A NAME="66:9">66:9</A><DD>Shall I bring to the birth, and not cause to bring forth? saith the LORD: shall I cause to bring forth, and shut <I>the womb</I>? saith thy God.
<DT><A NAME="66:10">66:10</A><DD>Rejoice ye with Jerusalem, and be glad with her, all ye that love her: rejoice for joy with her, all ye that mourn for her:
<DT><A NAME="66:11">66:11</A><DD>That ye may suck, and be satisfied with the breasts of her consolations; that ye may milk out, and be delighted with the abundance of her glory.
<DT><A NAME="66:12">66:12</A><DD>For thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will extend peace to her like a river, and the glory of the Gentiles like a flowing stream: then shall ye suck, ye shall be borne upon <I>her</I> sides, and be dandled upon <I>her</I> knees.
<DT><A NAME="66:13">66:13</A><DD>As one whom his mother comforteth, so will I comfort you; and ye shall be comforted in Jerusalem.
<DT><A NAME="66:14">66:14</A><DD>And when ye see <I>this</I>, your heart shall rejoice, and your bones shall flourish like an herb: and the hand of the LORD shall be known toward his servants, and <I>his</I> indignation toward his enemies.
<DT><A NAME="66:15">66:15</A><DD>For, behold, the LORD will come with fire, and with his chariots like a whirlwind, to render his anger with fury, and his rebuke with flames of fire.
<DT><A NAME="66:16">66:16</A><DD>For by fire and by his sword will the LORD plead with all flesh: and the slain of the LORD shall be many.
<DT><A NAME="66:17">66:17</A><DD>They that sanctify themselves, and purify themselves in the gardens behind one <I>tree</I> in the midst, eating swine's flesh, and the abomination, and the mouse, shall be consumed together, saith the LORD.
<DT><A NAME="66:18">66:18</A><DD>For I <I>know</I> their works and their thoughts: it shall come, that I will gather all nations and tongues; and they shall come, and see my glory.
<DT><A NAME="66:19">66:19</A><DD>And I will set a sign among them, and I will send those that escape of them unto the nations, <I>to</I> Tarshish, Pul, and Lud, that draw the bow, <I>to</I> Tubal, and Javan, <I>to</I> the isles afar off, that have not heard my fame, neither have seen my glory; and they shall declare my glory among the Gentiles.
<DT><A NAME="66:20">66:20</A><DD>And they shall bring all your brethren <I>for</I> an offering unto the LORD out of all nations upon horses, and in chariots, and in litters, and upon mules, and upon swift beasts, to my holy mountain Jerusalem, saith the LORD, as the children of Israel bring an offering in a clean vessel into the house of the LORD.
<DT><A NAME="66:21">66:21</A><DD>And I will also take of them for priests <I>and</I> for Levites, saith the LORD.
<DT><A NAME="66:22">66:22</A><DD>For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, shall remain before me, saith the LORD, so shall your seed and your name remain.

<DT><A NAME="66:24">66:24</A><DD>And they shall go forth, and look upon the carcases of the men that have transgressed against me: for their worm shall not die, neither shall their fire be quenched; and they shall be an abhorring unto all flesh.
