<H2>Chapter 1</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="1:1">1:1</A><DD>Now these <I>are</I> the names of the children of Israel, which came into Egypt; every man and his household came with Jacob.
<DT><A NAME="1:2">1:2</A><DD>Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah,
<DT><A NAME="1:3">1:3</A><DD>Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin,
<DT><A NAME="1:4">1:4</A><DD>Dan, and Naphtali, Gad, and Asher.
<DT><A NAME="1:5">1:5</A><DD>And all the souls that came out of the loins of Jacob were seventy souls: for Joseph was in Egypt <I>already</I>.
<DT><A NAME="1:6">1:6</A><DD>And Joseph died, and all his brethren, and all that generation.
<DT><A NAME="1:7">1:7</A><DD>And the children of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and multiplied, and waxed exceeding mighty; and the land was filled with them.
<DT><A NAME="1:8">1:8</A><DD>Now there arose up a new king over Egypt, which knew not Joseph.
<DT><A NAME="1:9">1:9</A><DD>And he said unto his people, Behold, the people of the children of Israel <I>are</I> more and mightier than we:
<DT><A NAME="1:10">1:10</A><DD>Come on, let us deal wisely with them; lest they multiply, and it come to pass, that, when there falleth out any war, they join also unto our enemies, and fight against us, and <I>so</I> get them up out of the land.
<DT><A NAME="1:11">1:11</A><DD>Therefore they did set over them taskmasters to afflict them with their burdens. And they built for Pharaoh treasure cities, Pithom and Raamses.
<DT><A NAME="1:12">1:12</A><DD>But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and grew. And they were grieved because of the children of Israel.
<DT><A NAME="1:13">1:13</A><DD>And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with rigour:
<DT><A NAME="1:14">1:14</A><DD>And they made their lives bitter with hard bondage, in morter, and in brick, and in all manner of service in the field: all their service, wherein they made them serve, <I>was</I> with rigour.
<DT><A NAME="1:15">1:15</A><DD>And the king of Egypt spake to the Hebrew midwives, of which the name of the one <I>was</I> Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah:
<DT><A NAME="1:16">1:16</A><DD>And he said, When ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women, and see <I>them</I> upon the stools; if it <I>be</I> a son, then ye shall kill him: but if it <I>be</I> a daughter, then she shall live.
<DT><A NAME="1:17">1:17</A><DD>But the midwives feared God, and did not as the king of Egypt commanded them, but saved the men children alive.
<DT><A NAME="1:18">1:18</A><DD>And the king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said unto them, Why have ye done this thing, and have saved the men children alive?
<DT><A NAME="1:19">1:19</A><DD>And the midwives said unto Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew women <I>are</I> not as the Egyptian women; for they <I>are</I> lively, and are delivered ere the midwives come in unto them.
<DT><A NAME="1:20">1:20</A><DD>Therefore God dealt well with the midwives: and the people multiplied, and waxed very mighty.
<DT><A NAME="1:21">1:21</A><DD>And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that he made them houses.
<DT><A NAME="1:22">1:22</A><DD>And Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, Every son that is born ye shall cast into the river, and every daughter ye shall save alive.
</DL></DIV><H2>Chapter 2</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="2:1">2:1</A><DD>And there went a man of the house of Levi, and took <I>to wife</I> a daughter of Levi.
<DT><A NAME="2:2">2:2</A><DD>And the woman conceived, and bare a son: and when she saw him that he <I>was a</I> goodly <I>child</I>, she hid him three months.
<DT><A NAME="2:3">2:3</A><DD>And when she could not longer hide him, she took for him an ark of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch, and put the child therein; and she laid <I>it</I> in the flags by the river's brink.
<DT><A NAME="2:4">2:4</A><DD>And his sister stood afar off, to wit what would be done to him.
<DT><A NAME="2:5">2:5</A><DD>And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to wash <I>herself</I> at the river; and her maidens walked along by the river's side; and when she saw the ark among the flags, she sent her maid to fetch it.
<DT><A NAME="2:6">2:6</A><DD>And when she had opened <I>it</I>, she saw the child: and, behold, the babe wept. And she had compassion on him, and said, This <I>is one</I> of the Hebrews' children.
<DT><A NAME="2:7">2:7</A><DD>Then said his sister to Pharaoh's daughter, Shall I go and call to thee a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for thee?
<DT><A NAME="2:8">2:8</A><DD>And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Go. And the maid went and called the child's mother.
<DT><A NAME="2:9">2:9</A><DD>And Pharaoh's daughter said unto her, Take this child away, and nurse it for me, and I will give <I>thee</I> thy wages. And the woman took the child, and nursed it.
<DT><A NAME="2:10">2:10</A><DD>And the child grew, and she brought him unto Pharaoh's daughter, and he became her son. And she called his name Moses: and she said, Because I drew him out of the water.
<DT><A NAME="2:11">2:11</A><DD>And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown, that he went out unto his brethren, and looked on their burdens: and he spied an Egyptian smiting an Hebrew, one of his brethren.
<DT><A NAME="2:12">2:12</A><DD>And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that <I>there was</I> no man, he slew the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand.
<DT><A NAME="2:13">2:13</A><DD>And when he went out the second day, behold, two men of the Hebrews strove together: and he said to him that did the wrong, Wherefore smitest thou thy fellow?
<DT><A NAME="2:14">2:14</A><DD>And he said, Who made thee a prince and a judge over us? intendest thou to kill me, as thou killedst the Egyptian? And Moses feared, and said, Surely this thing is known.
<DT><A NAME="2:15">2:15</A><DD>Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to slay Moses. But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of Midian: and he sat down by a well.
<DT><A NAME="2:16">2:16</A><DD>Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters: and they came and drew <I>water</I>, and filled the troughs to water their father's flock.
<DT><A NAME="2:17">2:17</A><DD>And the shepherds came and drove them away: but Moses stood up and helped them, and watered their flock.
<DT><A NAME="2:18">2:18</A><DD>And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, How <I>is it that</I> ye are come so soon to day?
<DT><A NAME="2:19">2:19</A><DD>And they said, An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds, and also drew <I>water</I> enough for us, and watered the flock.
<DT><A NAME="2:20">2:20</A><DD>And he said unto his daughters, And where <I>is</I> he? why <I>is</I> it <I>that</I> ye have left the man? call him, that he may eat bread.
<DT><A NAME="2:21">2:21</A><DD>And Moses was content to dwell with the man: and he gave Moses Zipporah his daughter.
<DT><A NAME="2:22">2:22</A><DD>And she bare <I>him</I> a son, and he called his name Gershom: for he said, I have been a stranger in a strange land.
<DT><A NAME="2:23">2:23</A><DD>And it came to pass in process of time, that the king of Egypt died: and the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage, and they cried, and their cry came up unto God by reason of the bondage.
<DT><A NAME="2:24">2:24</A><DD>And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.
<DT><A NAME="2:25">2:25</A><DD>And God looked upon the children of Israel, and God had respect unto <I>them</I>.
</DL></DIV><H2>Chapter 3</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="3:1">3:1</A><DD>Now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father in law, the priest of Midian: and he led the flock to the backside of the desert, and came to the mountain of God, <I>even</I> to Horeb.
<DT><A NAME="3:2">3:2</A><DD>And the angel of the LORD appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush: and he looked, and, behold, the bush burned with fire, and the bush <I>was</I> not consumed.
<DT><A NAME="3:3">3:3</A><DD>And Moses said, I will now turn aside, and see this great sight, why the bush is not burnt.
<DT><A NAME="3:4">3:4</A><DD>And when the LORD saw that he turned aside to see, God called unto him out of the midst of the bush, and said, Moses, Moses. And he said, Here <I>am</I> I.
<DT><A NAME="3:5">3:5</A><DD>And he said, Draw not nigh hither: put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest <I>is</I> holy ground.
<DT><A NAME="3:6">3:6</A><DD>Moreover he said, I <I>am</I> the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid his face; for he was afraid to look upon God.
<DT><A NAME="3:7">3:7</A><DD>And the LORD said, I have surely seen the affliction of my people which <I>are</I> in Egypt, and have heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters; for I know their sorrows;
<DT><A NAME="3:8">3:8</A><DD>And I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land unto a good land and a large, unto a land flowing with milk and honey; unto the place of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites.
<DT><A NAME="3:9">3:9</A><DD>Now therefore, behold, the cry of the children of Israel is come unto me: and I have also seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptians oppress them.
<DT><A NAME="3:10">3:10</A><DD>Come now therefore, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh, that thou mayest bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt.
<DT><A NAME="3:11">3:11</A><DD>And Moses said unto God, Who <I>am</I> I, that I should go unto Pharaoh, and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt?
<DT><A NAME="3:12">3:12</A><DD>And he said, Certainly I will be with thee; and this <I>shall be</I> a token unto thee, that I have sent thee: When thou hast brought forth the people out of Egypt, ye shall serve God upon this mountain.
<DT><A NAME="3:13">3:13</A><DD>And Moses said unto God, Behold, <I>when</I> I come unto the children of Israel, and shall say unto them, The God of your fathers hath sent me unto you; and they shall say to me, What <I>is</I> his name? what shall I say unto them?
<DT><A NAME="3:14">3:14</A><DD>And God said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto you.
<DT><A NAME="3:15">3:15</A><DD>And God said moreover unto Moses, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, The LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath sent me unto you: this <I>is</I> my name for ever, and this <I>is</I> my memorial unto all generations.
<DT><A NAME="3:16">3:16</A><DD>Go, and gather the elders of Israel together, and say unto them, The LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, appeared unto me, saying, I have surely visited you, and <I>seen</I> that which is done to you in Egypt:
<DT><A NAME="3:17">3:17</A><DD>And I have said, I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt unto the land of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, unto a land flowing with milk and honey.
<DT><A NAME="3:18">3:18</A><DD>And they shall hearken to thy voice: and thou shalt come, thou and the elders of Israel, unto the king of Egypt, and ye shall say unto him, The LORD God of the Hebrews hath met with us: and now let us go, we beseech thee, three days' journey into the wilderness, that we may sacrifice to the LORD our God.
<DT><A NAME="3:19">3:19</A><DD>And I am sure that the king of Egypt will not let you go, no, not by a mighty hand.
<DT><A NAME="3:20">3:20</A><DD>And I will stretch out my hand, and smite Egypt with all my wonders which I will do in the midst thereof: and after that he will let you go.
<DT><A NAME="3:21">3:21</A><DD>And I will give this people favour in the sight of the Egyptians: and it shall come to pass, that, when ye go, ye shall not go empty:
<DT><A NAME="3:22">3:22</A><DD>But every woman shall borrow of her neighbour, and of her that sojourneth in her house, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment: and ye shall put <I>them</I> upon your sons, and upon your daughters; and ye shall spoil the Egyptians.
</DL></DIV><H2>Chapter 4</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="4:1">4:1</A><DD>And Moses answered and said, But, behold, they will not believe me, nor hearken unto my voice: for they will say, The LORD hath not appeared unto thee.
<DT><A NAME="4:2">4:2</A><DD>And the LORD said unto him, What <I>is</I> that in thine hand? And he said, A rod.
<DT><A NAME="4:3">4:3</A><DD>And he said, Cast it on the ground. And he cast it on the ground, and it became a serpent; and Moses fled from before it.
<DT><A NAME="4:4">4:4</A><DD>And the LORD said unto Moses, Put forth thine hand, and take it by the tail. And he put forth his hand, and caught it, and it became a rod in his hand:
<DT><A NAME="4:5">4:5</A><DD>That they may believe that the LORD God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath appeared unto thee.
<DT><A NAME="4:6">4:6</A><DD>And the LORD said furthermore unto him, Put now thine hand into thy bosom. And he put his hand into his bosom: and when he took it out, behold, his hand <I>was</I> leprous as snow.
<DT><A NAME="4:7">4:7</A><DD>And he said, Put thine hand into thy bosom again. And he put his hand into his bosom again; and plucked it out of his bosom, and, behold, it was turned again as his <I>other</I> flesh.
<DT><A NAME="4:8">4:8</A><DD>And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe thee, neither hearken to the voice of the first sign, that they will believe the voice of the latter sign.
<DT><A NAME="4:9">4:9</A><DD>And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe also these two signs, neither hearken unto thy voice, that thou shalt take of the water of the river, and pour <I>it</I> upon the dry <I>land</I>: and the water which thou takest out of the river shall become blood upon the dry <I>land</I>.
<DT><A NAME="4:10">4:10</A><DD>And Moses said unto the LORD, O my Lord, I <I>am</I> not eloquent, neither heretofore, nor since thou hast spoken unto thy servant: but I <I>am</I> slow of speech, and of a slow tongue.
<DT><A NAME="4:11">4:11</A><DD>And the LORD said unto him, Who hath made man's mouth? or who maketh the dumb, or deaf, or the seeing, or the blind? have not I the LORD?
<DT><A NAME="4:12">4:12</A><DD>Now therefore go, and I will be with thy mouth, and teach thee what thou shalt say.
<DT><A NAME="4:13">4:13</A><DD>And he said, O my Lord, send, I pray thee, by the hand <I>of him whom</I> thou wilt send.
<DT><A NAME="4:14">4:14</A><DD>And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Moses, and he said, <I>Is</I> not Aaron the Levite thy brother? I know that he can speak well. And also, behold, he cometh forth to meet thee: and when he seeth thee, he will be glad in his heart.
<DT><A NAME="4:15">4:15</A><DD>And thou shalt speak unto him, and put words in his mouth: and I will be with thy mouth, and with his mouth, and will teach you what ye shall do.
<DT><A NAME="4:16">4:16</A><DD>And he shall be thy spokesman unto the people: and he shall be, <I>even</I> he shall be to thee instead of a mouth, and thou shalt be to him instead of God.
<DT><A NAME="4:17">4:17</A><DD>And thou shalt take this rod in thine hand, wherewith thou shalt do signs.
<DT><A NAME="4:18">4:18</A><DD>And Moses went and returned to Jethro his father in law, and said unto him, Let me go, I pray thee, and return unto my brethren which <I>are</I> in Egypt, and see whether they be yet alive. And Jethro said to Moses, Go in peace.
<DT><A NAME="4:19">4:19</A><DD>And the LORD said unto Moses in Midian, Go, return into Egypt: for all the men are dead which sought thy life.
<DT><A NAME="4:20">4:20</A><DD>And Moses took his wife and his sons, and set them upon an ass, and he returned to the land of Egypt: and Moses took the rod of God in his hand.
<DT><A NAME="4:21">4:21</A><DD>And the LORD said unto Moses, When thou goest to return into Egypt, see that thou do all those wonders before Pharaoh, which I have put in thine hand: but I will harden his heart, that he shall not let the people go.
<DT><A NAME="4:22">4:22</A><DD>And thou shalt say unto Pharaoh, Thus saith the LORD, Israel <I>is</I> my son, <I>even</I> my firstborn:
<DT><A NAME="4:23">4:23</A><DD>And I say unto thee, Let my son go, that he may serve me: and if thou refuse to let him go, behold, I will slay thy son, <I>even</I> thy firstborn.
<DT><A NAME="4:24">4:24</A><DD>And it came to pass by the way in the inn, that the LORD met him, and sought to kill him.
<DT><A NAME="4:25">4:25</A><DD>Then Zipporah took a sharp stone, and cut off the foreskin of her son, and cast <I>it</I> at his feet, and said, Surely a bloody husband <I>art</I> thou to me.
<DT><A NAME="4:26">4:26</A><DD>So he let him go: then she said, A bloody husband <I>thou art</I>, because of the circumcision.
<DT><A NAME="4:27">4:27</A><DD>And the LORD said to Aaron, Go into the wilderness to meet Moses. And he went, and met him in the mount of God, and kissed him.
<DT><A NAME="4:28">4:28</A><DD>And Moses told Aaron all the words of the LORD who had sent him, and all the signs which he had commanded him.
<DT><A NAME="4:29">4:29</A><DD>And Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the children of Israel:
<DT><A NAME="4:30">4:30</A><DD>And Aaron spake all the words which the LORD had spoken unto Moses, and did the signs in the sight of the people.
<DT><A NAME="4:31">4:31</A><DD>And the people believed: and when they heard that the LORD had visited the children of Israel, and that he had looked upon their affliction, then they bowed their heads and worshipped.
</DL></DIV><H2>Chapter 5</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="5:1">5:1</A><DD>And afterward Moses and Aaron went in, and told Pharaoh, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Let my people go, that they may hold a feast unto me in the wilderness.
<DT><A NAME="5:2">5:2</A><DD>And Pharaoh said, Who <I>is</I> the LORD, that I should obey his voice to let Israel go? I know not the LORD, neither will I let Israel go.
<DT><A NAME="5:3">5:3</A><DD>And they said, The God of the Hebrews hath met with us: let us go, we pray thee, three days' journey into the desert, and sacrifice unto the LORD our God; lest he fall upon us with pestilence, or with the sword.

<DT><A NAME="40:21">40:21</A><DD>And he brought the ark into the tabernacle, and set up the vail of the covering, and covered the ark of the testimony; as the LORD commanded Moses.
<DT><A NAME="40:22">40:22</A><DD>And he put the table in the tent of the congregation, upon the side of the tabernacle northward, without the vail.
<DT><A NAME="40:23">40:23</A><DD>And he set the bread in order upon it before the LORD; as the LORD had commanded Moses.

<DT><A NAME="40:27">40:27</A><DD>And he burnt sweet incense thereon; as the LORD commanded Moses.
<DT><A NAME="40:28">40:28</A><DD>And he set up the hanging <I>at</I> the door of the tabernacle.
<DT><A NAME="40:29">40:29</A><DD>And he put the altar of burnt offering <I>by</I> the door of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation, and offered upon it the burnt offering and the meat offering; as the LORD commanded Moses.

<DT><A NAME="40:35">40:35</A><DD>And Moses was not able to enter into the tent of the congregation, because the cloud abode thereon, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle.

<DT><A NAME="40:37">40:37</A><DD>But if the cloud were not taken up, then they journeyed not till the day that it was taken up.
