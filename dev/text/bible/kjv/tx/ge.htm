<H2>Chapter 1</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="1:1">1:1</A><DD>In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.
<DT><A NAME="1:2">1:2</A><DD>And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness <I>was</I> upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.
<DT><A NAME="1:3">1:3</A><DD>And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.
<DT><A NAME="1:4">1:4</A><DD>And God saw the light, that <I>it was</I> good: and God divided the light from the darkness.
<DT><A NAME="1:5">1:5</A><DD>And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.
<DT><A NAME="1:6">1:6</A><DD>And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.
<DT><A NAME="1:7">1:7</A><DD>And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which <I>were</I> under the firmament from the waters which <I>were</I> above the firmament: and it was so.
<DT><A NAME="1:8">1:8</A><DD>And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the morning were the second day.
<DT><A NAME="1:9">1:9</A><DD>And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry <I>land</I> appear: and it was so.
<DT><A NAME="1:10">1:10</A><DD>And God called the dry <I>land</I> Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that <I>it was</I> good.
<DT><A NAME="1:11">1:11</A><DD>And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, <I>and</I> the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed <I>is</I> in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.
<DT><A NAME="1:12">1:12</A><DD>And the earth brought forth grass, <I>and</I> herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed <I>was</I> in itself, after his kind: and God saw that <I>it was</I> good.
<DT><A NAME="1:13">1:13</A><DD>And the evening and the morning were the third day.
<DT><A NAME="1:14">1:14</A><DD>And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years:
<DT><A NAME="1:15">1:15</A><DD>And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so.
<DT><A NAME="1:16">1:16</A><DD>And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: <I>he made</I> the stars also.
<DT><A NAME="1:17">1:17</A><DD>And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth,
<DT><A NAME="1:18">1:18</A><DD>And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that <I>it was</I> good.
<DT><A NAME="1:19">1:19</A><DD>And the evening and the morning were the fourth day.
<DT><A NAME="1:20">1:20</A><DD>And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life, and fowl <I>that</I> may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven.
<DT><A NAME="1:21">1:21</A><DD>And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that <I>it was</I> good.
<DT><A NAME="1:22">1:22</A><DD>And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.
<DT><A NAME="1:23">1:23</A><DD>And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.
<DT><A NAME="1:24">1:24</A><DD>And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so.
<DT><A NAME="1:25">1:25</A><DD>And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that <I>it was</I> good.
<DT><A NAME="1:26">1:26</A><DD>And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.
<DT><A NAME="1:27">1:27</A><DD>So God created man in his <I>own</I> image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.
<DT><A NAME="1:28">1:28</A><DD>And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.
<DT><A NAME="1:29">1:29</A><DD>And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which <I>is</I> upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which <I>is</I> the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.
<DT><A NAME="1:30">1:30</A><DD>And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein <I>there is</I> life, <I>I have given</I> every green herb for meat: and it was so.
<DT><A NAME="1:31">1:31</A><DD>And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, <I>it was</I> very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.
</DL></DIV><H2>Chapter 2</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="2:1">2:1</A><DD>Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them.
<DT><A NAME="2:2">2:2</A><DD>And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.
<DT><A NAME="2:3">2:3</A><DD>And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made.
<DT><A NAME="2:4">2:4</A><DD>These <I>are</I> the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that the LORD God made the earth and the heavens,
<DT><A NAME="2:5">2:5</A><DD>And every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew: for the LORD God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and <I>there was</I> not a man to till the ground.
<DT><A NAME="2:6">2:6</A><DD>But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground.
<DT><A NAME="2:7">2:7</A><DD>And the LORD God formed man <I>of</I> the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.
<DT><A NAME="2:8">2:8</A><DD>And the LORD God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he put the man whom he had formed.
<DT><A NAME="2:9">2:9</A><DD>And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.
<DT><A NAME="2:10">2:10</A><DD>And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became into four heads.
<DT><A NAME="2:11">2:11</A><DD>The name of the first <I>is</I> Pison: that <I>is</I> it which compasseth the whole land of Havilah, where <I>there is</I> gold;
<DT><A NAME="2:12">2:12</A><DD>And the gold of that land <I>is</I> good: there <I>is</I> bdellium and the onyx stone.
<DT><A NAME="2:13">2:13</A><DD>And the name of the second river <I>is</I> Gihon: the same <I>is</I> it that compasseth the whole land of Ethiopia.
<DT><A NAME="2:14">2:14</A><DD>And the name of the third river <I>is</I> Hiddekel: that <I>is</I> it which goeth toward the east of Assyria. And the fourth river <I>is</I> Euphrates.
<DT><A NAME="2:15">2:15</A><DD>And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it.
<DT><A NAME="2:16">2:16</A><DD>And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat:
<DT><A NAME="2:17">2:17</A><DD>But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.
<DT><A NAME="2:18">2:18</A><DD>And the LORD God said, <I>It is</I> not good that the man should be alone; I will make him an help meet for him.
<DT><A NAME="2:19">2:19</A><DD>And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and brought <I>them</I> unto Adam to see what he would call them: and whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that <I>was</I> the name thereof.
<DT><A NAME="2:20">2:20</A><DD>And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every beast of the field; but for Adam there was not found an help meet for him.
<DT><A NAME="2:21">2:21</A><DD>And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept: and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof;
<DT><A NAME="2:22">2:22</A><DD>And the rib, which the LORD God had taken from man, made he a woman, and brought her unto the man.
<DT><A NAME="2:23">2:23</A><DD>And Adam said, This <I>is</I> now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.
<DT><A NAME="2:24">2:24</A><DD>Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.
<DT><A NAME="2:25">2:25</A><DD>And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.
</DL></DIV><H2>Chapter 3</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="3:1">3:1</A><DD>Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?
<DT><A NAME="3:2">3:2</A><DD>And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden:
<DT><A NAME="3:3">3:3</A><DD>But of the fruit of the tree which <I>is</I> in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.
<DT><A NAME="3:4">3:4</A><DD>And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die:
<DT><A NAME="3:5">3:5</A><DD>For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.
<DT><A NAME="3:6">3:6</A><DD>And when the woman saw that the tree <I>was</I> good for food, and that it <I>was</I> pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make <I>one</I> wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat.
<DT><A NAME="3:7">3:7</A><DD>And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they <I>were</I> naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons.
<DT><A NAME="3:8">3:8</A><DD>And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God amongst the trees of the garden.
<DT><A NAME="3:9">3:9</A><DD>And the LORD God called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where <I>art</I> thou?
<DT><A NAME="3:10">3:10</A><DD>And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I <I>was</I> naked; and I hid myself.
<DT><A NAME="3:11">3:11</A><DD>And he said, Who told thee that thou <I>wast</I> naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?
<DT><A NAME="3:12">3:12</A><DD>And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest <I>to be</I> with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.
<DT><A NAME="3:13">3:13</A><DD>And the LORD God said unto the woman, What <I>is</I> this <I>that</I> thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.
<DT><A NAME="3:14">3:14</A><DD>And the LORD God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou <I>art</I> cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:
<DT><A NAME="3:15">3:15</A><DD>And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.
<DT><A NAME="3:16">3:16</A><DD>Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire <I>shall be</I> to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.
<DT><A NAME="3:17">3:17</A><DD>And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed <I>is</I> the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat <I>of</I> it all the days of thy life;
<DT><A NAME="3:18">3:18</A><DD>Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field;
<DT><A NAME="3:19">3:19</A><DD>In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou <I>art</I>, and unto dust shalt thou return.
<DT><A NAME="3:20">3:20</A><DD>And Adam called his wife's name Eve; because she was the mother of all living.
<DT><A NAME="3:21">3:21</A><DD>Unto Adam also and to his wife did the LORD God make coats of skins, and clothed them.
<DT><A NAME="3:22">3:22</A><DD>And the LORD God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:
<DT><A NAME="3:23">3:23</A><DD>Therefore the LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken.
<DT><A NAME="3:24">3:24</A><DD>So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.
</DL></DIV><H2>Chapter 4</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="4:1">4:1</A><DD>And Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bare Cain, and said, I have gotten a man from the LORD.
<DT><A NAME="4:2">4:2</A><DD>And she again bare his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.
<DT><A NAME="4:3">4:3</A><DD>And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the LORD.
<DT><A NAME="4:4">4:4</A><DD>And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof. And the LORD had respect unto Abel and to his offering:
<DT><A NAME="4:5">4:5</A><DD>But unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect. And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell.
<DT><A NAME="4:6">4:6</A><DD>And the LORD said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen?
<DT><A NAME="4:7">4:7</A><DD>If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door. And unto thee <I>shall be</I> his desire, and thou shalt rule over him.
<DT><A NAME="4:8">4:8</A><DD>And Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him.
<DT><A NAME="4:9">4:9</A><DD>And the LORD said unto Cain, Where <I>is</I> Abel thy brother? And he said, I know not: <I>Am</I> I my brother's keeper?
<DT><A NAME="4:10">4:10</A><DD>And he said, What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me from the ground.
<DT><A NAME="4:11">4:11</A><DD>And now <I>art</I> thou cursed from the earth, which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand;
<DT><A NAME="4:12">4:12</A><DD>When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth.
<DT><A NAME="4:13">4:13</A><DD>And Cain said unto the LORD, My punishment <I>is</I> greater than I can bear.
<DT><A NAME="4:14">4:14</A><DD>Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass, <I>that</I> every one that findeth me shall slay me.
<DT><A NAME="4:15">4:15</A><DD>And the LORD said unto him, Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. And the LORD set a mark upon Cain, lest any finding him should kill him.
<DT><A NAME="4:16">4:16</A><DD>And Cain went out from the presence of the LORD, and dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden.
<DT><A NAME="4:17">4:17</A><DD>And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bare Enoch: and he builded a city, and called the name of the city, after the name of his son, Enoch.
<DT><A NAME="4:18">4:18</A><DD>And unto Enoch was born Irad: and Irad begat Mehujael: and Mehujael begat Methusael: and Methusael begat Lamech.
<DT><A NAME="4:19">4:19</A><DD>And Lamech took unto him two wives: the name of the one <I>was</I> Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.
<DT><A NAME="4:20">4:20</A><DD>And Adah bare Jabal: he was the father of such as dwell in tents, and <I>of such as have</I> cattle.
<DT><A NAME="4:21">4:21</A><DD>And his brother's name <I>was</I> Jubal: he was the father of all such as handle the harp and organ.
<DT><A NAME="4:22">4:22</A><DD>And Zillah, she also bare Tubalcain, an instructer of every artificer in brass and iron: and the sister of Tubalcain <I>was</I> Naamah.
<DT><A NAME="4:23">4:23</A><DD>And Lamech said unto his wives, Adah and Zillah, Hear my voice; ye wives of Lamech, hearken unto my speech: for I have slain a man to my wounding, and a young man to my hurt.
<DT><A NAME="4:24">4:24</A><DD>If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy and sevenfold.
<DT><A NAME="4:25">4:25</A><DD>And Adam knew his wife again; and she bare a son, and called his name Seth: For God, <I>said she</I>, hath appointed me another seed instead of Abel, whom Cain slew.
<DT><A NAME="4:26">4:26</A><DD>And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his name Enos: then began men to call upon the name of the LORD.

<DT><A NAME="8:5">8:5</A><DD>And the waters decreased continually until the tenth month: in the tenth <I>month</I>, on the first <I>day</I> of the month, were the tops of the mountains seen.

<DT><A NAME="8:8">8:8</A><DD>Also he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters were abated from off the face of the ground;
<DT><A NAME="8:9">8:9</A><DD>But the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot, and she returned unto him into the ark, for the waters <I>were</I> on the face of the whole earth: then he put forth his hand, and took her, and pulled her in unto him into the ark.
<DT><A NAME="8:10">8:10</A><DD>And he stayed yet other seven days; and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark;

<DT><A NAME="8:20">8:20</A><DD>And Noah builded an altar unto the LORD; and took of every clean beast, and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt offerings on the altar.
<DT><A NAME="8:21">8:21</A><DD>And the LORD smelled a sweet savour; and the LORD said in his heart, I will not again curse the ground any more for man's sake; for the imagination of man's heart <I>is</I> evil from his youth; neither will I again smite any more every thing living, as I have done.

<DT><A NAME="37:1">37:1</A><DD>And Jacob dwelt in the land wherein his father was a stranger, in the land of Canaan.
<DT><A NAME="37:2">37:2</A><DD>These <I>are</I> the generations of Jacob. Joseph, <I>being</I> seventeen years old, was feeding the flock with his brethren; and the lad <I>was</I> with the sons of Bilhah, and with the sons of Zilpah, his father's wives: and Joseph brought unto his father their evil report.
<DT><A NAME="37:3">37:3</A><DD>Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he <I>was</I> the son of his old age: and he made him a coat of <I>many</I> colours.
<DT><A NAME="37:4">37:4</A><DD>And when his brethren saw that their father loved him more than all his brethren, they hated him, and could not speak peaceably unto him.
<DT><A NAME="37:5">37:5</A><DD>And Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told <I>it</I> his brethren: and they hated him yet the more.
<DT><A NAME="37:6">37:6</A><DD>And he said unto them, Hear, I pray you, this dream which I have dreamed:
<DT><A NAME="37:7">37:7</A><DD>For, behold, we <I>were</I> binding sheaves in the field, and, lo, my sheaf arose, and also stood upright; and, behold, your sheaves stood round about, and made obeisance to my sheaf.
<DT><A NAME="37:8">37:8</A><DD>And his brethren said to him, Shalt thou indeed reign over us? or shalt thou indeed have dominion over us? And they hated him yet the more for his dreams, and for his words.
<DT><A NAME="37:9">37:9</A><DD>And he dreamed yet another dream, and told it his brethren, and said, Behold, I have dreamed a dream more; and, behold, the sun and the moon and the eleven stars made obeisance to me.
<DT><A NAME="37:10">37:10</A><DD>And he told <I>it</I> to his father, and to his brethren: and his father rebuked him, and said unto him, What <I>is</I> this dream that thou hast dreamed? Shall I and thy mother and thy brethren indeed come to bow down ourselves to thee to the earth?
<DT><A NAME="37:11">37:11</A><DD>And his brethren envied him; but his father observed the saying.
<DT><A NAME="37:12">37:12</A><DD>And his brethren went to feed their father's flock in Shechem.
<DT><A NAME="37:13">37:13</A><DD>And Israel said unto Joseph, Do not thy brethren feed <I>the flock</I> in Shechem? come, and I will send thee unto them. And he said to him, Here <I>am I</I>.
<DT><A NAME="37:14">37:14</A><DD>And he said to him, Go, I pray thee, see whether it be well with thy brethren, and well with the flocks; and bring me word again. So he sent him out of the vale of Hebron, and he came to Shechem.
<DT><A NAME="37:15">37:15</A><DD>And a certain man found him, and, behold, <I>he was</I> wandering in the field: and the man asked him, saying, What seekest thou?

<DT><A NAME="37:17">37:17</A><DD>And the man said, They are departed hence; for I heard them say, Let us go to Dothan. And Joseph went after his brethren, and found them in Dothan.
<DT><A NAME="37:18">37:18</A><DD>And when they saw him afar off, even before he came near unto them, they conspired against him to slay him.
<DT><A NAME="37:19">37:19</A><DD>And they said one to another, Behold, this dreamer cometh.
<DT><A NAME="37:20">37:20</A><DD>Come now therefore, and let us slay him, and cast him into some pit, and we will say, Some evil beast hath devoured him: and we shall see what will become of his dreams.

<DT><A NAME="37:23">37:23</A><DD>And it came to pass, when Joseph was come unto his brethren, that they stript Joseph out of his coat, <I>his</I> coat of <I>many</I> colours that <I>was</I> on him;
<DT><A NAME="37:24">37:24</A><DD>And they took him, and cast him into a pit: and the pit <I>was</I> empty, <I>there was</I> no water in it.
<DT><A NAME="37:25">37:25</A><DD>And they sat down to eat bread: and they lifted up their eyes and looked, and, behold, a company of Ishmeelites came from Gilead with their camels bearing spicery and balm and myrrh, going to carry <I>it</I> down to Egypt.
<DT><A NAME="37:26">37:26</A><DD>And Judah said unto his brethren, What profit <I>is it</I> if we slay our brother, and conceal his blood?
<DT><A NAME="37:27">37:27</A><DD>Come, and let us sell him to the Ishmeelites, and let not our hand be upon him; for he <I>is</I> our brother <I>and</I> our flesh. And his brethren were content.
<DT><A NAME="37:28">37:28</A><DD>Then there passed by Midianites merchantmen; and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmeelites for twenty <I>pieces</I> of silver: and they brought Joseph into Egypt.
<DT><A NAME="37:29">37:29</A><DD>And Reuben returned unto the pit; and, behold, Joseph <I>was</I> not in the pit; and he rent his clothes.
<DT><A NAME="37:30">37:30</A><DD>And he returned unto his brethren, and said, The child <I>is</I> not; and I, whither shall I go?
<DT><A NAME="37:31">37:31</A><DD>And they took Joseph's coat, and killed a kid of the goats, and dipped the coat in the blood;
<DT><A NAME="37:32">37:32</A><DD>And they sent the coat of <I>many</I> colours, and they brought <I>it</I> to their father; and said, This have we found: know now whether it <I>be</I> thy son's coat or no.
<DT><A NAME="37:33">37:33</A><DD>And he knew it, and said, <I>It is</I> my son's coat; an evil beast hath devoured him; Joseph is without doubt rent in pieces.
<DT><A NAME="37:34">37:34</A><DD>And Jacob rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his loins, and mourned for his son many days.
<DT><A NAME="37:35">37:35</A><DD>And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him; but he refused to be comforted; and he said, For I will go down into the grave unto my son mourning. Thus his father wept for him.
<DT><A NAME="37:36">37:36</A><DD>And the Midianites sold him into Egypt unto Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh's, <I>and</I> captain of the guard.

<DT><A NAME="38:1">38:1</A><DD>And it came to pass at that time, that Judah went down from his brethren, and turned in to a certain Adullamite, whose name <I>was</I> Hirah.

<DT><A NAME="38:4">38:4</A><DD>And she conceived again, and bare a son; and she called his name Onan.
<DT><A NAME="38:5">38:5</A><DD>And she yet again conceived, and bare a son; and called his name Shelah: and he was at Chezib, when she bare him.

<DT><A NAME="38:8">38:8</A><DD>And Judah said unto Onan, Go in unto thy brother's wife, and marry her, and raise up seed to thy brother.
<DT><A NAME="38:9">38:9</A><DD>And Onan knew that the seed should not be his; and it came to pass, when he went in unto his brother's wife, that he spilled <I>it</I> on the ground, lest that he should give seed to his brother.
<DT><A NAME="38:10">38:10</A><DD>And the thing which he did displeased the LORD: wherefore he slew him also.
<DT><A NAME="38:11">38:11</A><DD>Then said Judah to Tamar his daughter in law, Remain a widow at thy father's house, till Shelah my son be grown: for he said, Lest peradventure he die also, as his brethren <I>did</I>. And Tamar went and dwelt in her father's house.
<DT><A NAME="38:12">38:12</A><DD>And in process of time the daughter of Shuah Judah's wife died; and Judah was comforted, and went up unto his sheepshearers to Timnath, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite.
<DT><A NAME="38:13">38:13</A><DD>And it was told Tamar, saying, Behold thy father in law goeth up to Timnath to shear his sheep.
<DT><A NAME="38:14">38:14</A><DD>And she put her widow's garments off from her, and covered her with a vail, and wrapped herself, and sat in an open place, which <I>is</I> by the way to Timnath; for she saw that Shelah was grown, and she was not given unto him to wife.
<DT><A NAME="38:15">38:15</A><DD>When Judah saw her, he thought her <I>to be</I> an harlot; because she had covered her face.
<DT><A NAME="38:16">38:16</A><DD>And he turned unto her by the way, and said, Go to, I pray thee, let me come in unto thee; (for he knew not that she <I>was</I> his daughter in law.) And she said, What wilt thou give me, that thou mayest come in unto me?
<DT><A NAME="38:17">38:17</A><DD>And he said, I will send <I>thee</I> a kid from the flock. And she said, Wilt thou give <I>me</I> a pledge, till thou send <I>it</I>?
<DT><A NAME="38:18">38:18</A><DD>And he said, What pledge shall I give thee? And she said, Thy signet, and thy bracelets, and thy staff that <I>is</I> in thine hand. And he gave <I>it</I> her, and came in unto her, and she conceived by him.
<DT><A NAME="38:19">38:19</A><DD>And she arose, and went away, and laid by her vail from her, and put on the garments of her widowhood.
<DT><A NAME="38:20">38:20</A><DD>And Judah sent the kid by the hand of his friend the Adullamite, to receive <I>his</I> pledge from the woman's hand: but he found her not.
<DT><A NAME="38:21">38:21</A><DD>Then he asked the men of that place, saying, Where <I>is</I> the harlot, that <I>was</I> openly by the way side? And they said, There was no harlot in this <I>place</I>.
<DT><A NAME="38:22">38:22</A><DD>And he returned to Judah, and said, I cannot find her; and also the men of the place said, <I>that</I> there was no harlot in this <I>place</I>.
<DT><A NAME="38:23">38:23</A><DD>And Judah said, Let her take <I>it</I> to her, lest we be shamed: behold, I sent this kid, and thou hast not found her.
<DT><A NAME="38:24">38:24</A><DD>And it came to pass about three months after, that it was told Judah, saying, Tamar thy daughter in law hath played the harlot; and also, behold, she <I>is</I> with child by whoredom. And Judah said, Bring her forth, and let her be burnt.
<DT><A NAME="38:25">38:25</A><DD>When she <I>was</I> brought forth, she sent to her father in law, saying, By the man, whose these <I>are, am</I> I with child: and she said, Discern, I pray thee, whose <I>are</I> these, the signet, and bracelets, and staff.
<DT><A NAME="38:26">38:26</A><DD>And Judah acknowledged <I>them</I>, and said, She hath been more righteous than I; because that I gave her not to Shelah my son. And he knew her again no more.

<DT><A NAME="41:17">41:17</A><DD>And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, In my dream, behold, I stood upon the bank of the river:
<DT><A NAME="41:18">41:18</A><DD>And, behold, there came up out of the river seven kine, fatfleshed and well favoured; and they fed in a meadow:
<DT><A NAME="41:19">41:19</A><DD>And, behold, seven other kine came up after them, poor and very ill favoured and leanfleshed, such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt for badness:
<DT><A NAME="41:20">41:20</A><DD>And the lean and the ill favoured kine did eat up the first seven fat kine:
<DT><A NAME="41:21">41:21</A><DD>And when they had eaten them up, it could not be known that they had eaten them; but they <I>were</I> still ill favoured, as at the beginning. So I awoke.
<DT><A NAME="41:22">41:22</A><DD>And I saw in my dream, and, behold, seven ears came up in one stalk, full and good:
<DT><A NAME="41:23">41:23</A><DD>And, behold, seven ears, withered, thin, <I>and</I> blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them:
<DT><A NAME="41:24">41:24</A><DD>And the thin ears devoured the seven good ears: and I told <I>this</I> unto the magicians; but <I>there was</I> none that could declare <I>it</I> to me.
<DT><A NAME="41:25">41:25</A><DD>And Joseph said unto Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh <I>is</I> one: God hath shewed Pharaoh what he <I>is</I> about to do.
<DT><A NAME="41:26">41:26</A><DD>The seven good kine <I>are</I> seven years; and the seven good ears <I>are</I> seven years: the dream <I>is</I> one.
<DT><A NAME="41:27">41:27</A><DD>And the seven thin and ill favoured kine that came up after them <I>are</I> seven years; and the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind shall be seven years of famine.
<DT><A NAME="41:28">41:28</A><DD>This <I>is</I> the thing which I have spoken unto Pharaoh: What God <I>is</I> about to do he sheweth unto Pharaoh.
<DT><A NAME="41:29">41:29</A><DD>Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt:
<DT><A NAME="41:30">41:30</A><DD>And there shall arise after them seven years of famine; and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt; and the famine shall consume the land;
<DT><A NAME="41:31">41:31</A><DD>And the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of that famine following; for it <I>shall be</I> very grievous.
<DT><A NAME="41:32">41:32</A><DD>And for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice; <I>it is</I> because the thing <I>is</I> established by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass.
<DT><A NAME="41:33">41:33</A><DD>Now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise, and set him over the land of Egypt.
<DT><A NAME="41:34">41:34</A><DD>Let Pharaoh do <I>this</I>, and let him appoint officers over the land, and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven plenteous years.
<DT><A NAME="41:35">41:35</A><DD>And let them gather all the food of those good years that come, and lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh, and let them keep food in the cities.
<DT><A NAME="41:36">41:36</A><DD>And that food shall be for store to the land against the seven years of famine, which shall be in the land of Egypt; that the land perish not through the famine.
<DT><A NAME="41:37">41:37</A><DD>And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all his servants.
<DT><A NAME="41:38">41:38</A><DD>And Pharaoh said unto his servants, Can we find <I>such a one</I> as this <I>is</I>, a man in whom the Spirit of God <I>is</I>?
<DT><A NAME="41:39">41:39</A><DD>And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Forasmuch as God hath shewed thee all this, <I>there is</I> none so discreet and wise as thou <I>art</I>:

<DT><A NAME="41:41">41:41</A><DD>And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, See, I have set thee over all the land of Egypt.
<DT><A NAME="41:42">41:42</A><DD>And Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand, and put it upon Joseph's hand, and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen, and put a gold chain about his neck;
<DT><A NAME="41:43">41:43</A><DD>And he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had; and they cried before him, Bow the knee: and he made him <I>ruler</I> over all the land of Egypt.
<DT><A NAME="41:44">41:44</A><DD>And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I <I>am</I> Pharaoh, and without thee shall no man lift up his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt.
<DT><A NAME="41:45">41:45</A><DD>And Pharaoh called Joseph's name Zaphnathpaaneah; and he gave him to wife Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On. And Joseph went out over <I>all</I> the land of Egypt.
<DT><A NAME="41:46">41:46</A><DD>And Joseph <I>was</I> thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went throughout all the land of Egypt.
<DT><A NAME="41:47">41:47</A><DD>And in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by handfuls.
<DT><A NAME="41:48">41:48</A><DD>And he gathered up all the food of the seven years, which were in the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities: the food of the field, which <I>was</I> round about every city, laid he up in the same.
<DT><A NAME="41:49">41:49</A><DD>And Joseph gathered corn as the sand of the sea, very much, until he left numbering; for <I>it was</I> without number.
<DT><A NAME="41:50">41:50</A><DD>And unto Joseph were born two sons before the years of famine came, which Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On bare unto him.
<DT><A NAME="41:51">41:51</A><DD>And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh: For God, <I>said he</I>, hath made me forget all my toil, and all my father's house.
<DT><A NAME="41:52">41:52</A><DD>And the name of the second called he Ephraim: For God hath caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction.
<DT><A NAME="41:53">41:53</A><DD>And the seven years of plenteousness, that was in the land of Egypt, were ended.
<DT><A NAME="41:54">41:54</A><DD>And the seven years of dearth began to come, according as Joseph had said: and the dearth was in all lands; but in all the land of Egypt there was bread.
<DT><A NAME="41:55">41:55</A><DD>And when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread: and Pharaoh said unto all the Egyptians, Go unto Joseph; what he saith to you, do.
<DT><A NAME="41:56">41:56</A><DD>And the famine was over all the face of the earth: And Joseph opened all the storehouses, and sold unto the Egyptians; and the famine waxed sore in the land of Egypt.
<DT><A NAME="41:57">41:57</A><DD>And all countries came into Egypt to Joseph for to buy <I>corn</I>; because that the famine was <I>so</I> sore in all lands.

<DT><A NAME="42:14">42:14</A><DD>And Joseph said unto them, That <I>is it</I> that I spake unto you, saying, Ye <I>are</I> spies:
<DT><A NAME="42:15">42:15</A><DD>Hereby ye shall be proved: By the life of Pharaoh ye shall not go forth hence, except your youngest brother come hither.
<DT><A NAME="42:16">42:16</A><DD>Send one of you, and let him fetch your brother, and ye shall be kept in prison, that your words may be proved, whether <I>there be any</I> truth in you: or else by the life of Pharaoh surely ye <I>are</I> spies.

<DT><A NAME="42:21">42:21</A><DD>And they said one to another, We <I>are</I> verily guilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the anguish of his soul, when he besought us, and we would not hear; therefore is this distress come upon us.
<DT><A NAME="42:22">42:22</A><DD>And Reuben answered them, saying, Spake I not unto you, saying, Do not sin against the child; and ye would not hear? therefore, behold, also his blood is required.
<DT><A NAME="42:23">42:23</A><DD>And they knew not that Joseph understood <I>them</I>; for he spake unto them by an interpreter.
<DT><A NAME="42:24">42:24</A><DD>And he turned himself about from them, and wept; and returned to them again, and communed with them, and took from them Simeon, and bound him before their eyes.

<DT><A NAME="42:35">42:35</A><DD>And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks, that, behold, every man's bundle of money <I>was</I> in his sack: and when <I>both</I> they and their father saw the bundles of money, they were afraid.
<DT><A NAME="42:36">42:36</A><DD>And Jacob their father said unto them, Me have ye bereaved <I>of my children</I>: Joseph <I>is</I> not, and Simeon <I>is</I> not, and ye will take Benjamin <I>away</I>: all these things are against me.
