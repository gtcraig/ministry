<H2>Chapter 1</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="1:1">1:1</A><DD>The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God;
<DT><A NAME="1:2">1:2</A><DD>As it is written in the prophets, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.
<DT><A NAME="1:3">1:3</A><DD>The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.
<DT><A NAME="1:4">1:4</A><DD>John did baptize in the wilderness, and preach the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins.
<DT><A NAME="1:5">1:5</A><DD>And there went out unto him all the land of Judaea, and they of Jerusalem, and were all baptized of him in the river of Jordan, confessing their sins.
<DT><A NAME="1:6">1:6</A><DD>And John was clothed with camel's hair, and with a girdle of a skin about his loins; and he did eat locusts and wild honey;
<DT><A NAME="1:7">1:7</A><DD>And preached, saying, There cometh one mightier than I after me, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and unloose.
<DT><A NAME="1:8">1:8</A><DD>I indeed have baptized you with water: but he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost.
<DT><A NAME="1:9">1:9</A><DD>And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized of John in Jordan.
<DT><A NAME="1:10">1:10</A><DD>And straightway coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens opened, and the Spirit like a dove descending upon him:
<DT><A NAME="1:11">1:11</A><DD>And there came a voice from heaven, <I>saying</I>, Thou art my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.
<DT><A NAME="1:12">1:12</A><DD>And immediately the Spirit driveth him into the wilderness.
<DT><A NAME="1:13">1:13</A><DD>And he was there in the wilderness forty days, tempted of Satan; and was with the wild beasts; and the angels ministered unto him.
<DT><A NAME="1:14">1:14</A><DD>Now after that John was put in prison, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God,
<DT><A NAME="1:15">1:15</A><DD>And saying, <FONT CLASS=r>The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel.</FONT>
<DT><A NAME="1:16">1:16</A><DD>Now as he walked by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers.
<DT><A NAME="1:17">1:17</A><DD>And Jesus said unto them, <FONT CLASS=r>Come ye after me, and I will make you to become fishers of men.</FONT>
<DT><A NAME="1:18">1:18</A><DD>And straightway they forsook their nets, and followed him.
<DT><A NAME="1:19">1:19</A><DD>And when he had gone a little further thence, he saw James the <I>son</I> of Zebedee, and John his brother, who also were in the ship mending their nets.
<DT><A NAME="1:20">1:20</A><DD>And straightway he called them: and they left their father Zebedee in the ship with the hired servants, and went after him.
<DT><A NAME="1:21">1:21</A><DD>And they went into Capernaum; and straightway on the sabbath day he entered into the synagogue, and taught.
<DT><A NAME="1:22">1:22</A><DD>And they were astonished at his doctrine: for he taught them as one that had authority, and not as the scribes.
<DT><A NAME="1:23">1:23</A><DD>And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit; and he cried out,
<DT><A NAME="1:24">1:24</A><DD>Saying, Let <I>us</I> alone; what have we to do with thee, thou Jesus of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art, the Holy One of God.
<DT><A NAME="1:25">1:25</A><DD>And Jesus rebuked him, saying, <FONT CLASS=r>Hold thy peace, and come out of him.</FONT>
<DT><A NAME="1:26">1:26</A><DD>And when the unclean spirit had torn him, and cried with a loud voice, he came out of him.
<DT><A NAME="1:27">1:27</A><DD>And they were all amazed, insomuch that they questioned among themselves, saying, What thing is this? what new doctrine <I>is</I> this? for with authority commandeth he even the unclean spirits, and they do obey him.
<DT><A NAME="1:28">1:28</A><DD>And immediately his fame spread abroad throughout all the region round about Galilee.
<DT><A NAME="1:29">1:29</A><DD>And forthwith, when they were come out of the synagogue, they entered into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.
<DT><A NAME="1:30">1:30</A><DD>But Simon's wife's mother lay sick of a fever, and anon they tell him of her.
<DT><A NAME="1:31">1:31</A><DD>And he came and took her by the hand, and lifted her up; and immediately the fever left her, and she ministered unto them.
<DT><A NAME="1:32">1:32</A><DD>And at even, when the sun did set, they brought unto him all that were diseased, and them that were possessed with devils.
<DT><A NAME="1:33">1:33</A><DD>And all the city was gathered together at the door.
<DT><A NAME="1:34">1:34</A><DD>And he healed many that were sick of divers diseases, and cast out many devils; and suffered not the devils to speak, because they knew him.
<DT><A NAME="1:35">1:35</A><DD>And in the morning, rising up a great while before day, he went out, and departed into a solitary place, and there prayed.
<DT><A NAME="1:36">1:36</A><DD>And Simon and they that were with him followed after him.
<DT><A NAME="1:37">1:37</A><DD>And when they had found him, they said unto him, All <I>men</I> seek for thee.
<DT><A NAME="1:38">1:38</A><DD>And he said unto them, <FONT CLASS=r>Let us go into the next towns, that I may preach there also: for therefore came I forth.</FONT>
<DT><A NAME="1:39">1:39</A><DD>And he preached in their synagogues throughout all Galilee, and cast out devils.
<DT><A NAME="1:40">1:40</A><DD>And there came a leper to him, beseeching him, and kneeling down to him, and saying unto him, If thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.
<DT><A NAME="1:41">1:41</A><DD>And Jesus, moved with compassion, put forth <I>his</I> hand, and touched him, and saith unto him, <FONT CLASS=r>I will; be thou clean.</FONT>
<DT><A NAME="1:42">1:42</A><DD>And as soon as he had spoken, immediately the leprosy departed from him, and he was cleansed.
<DT><A NAME="1:43">1:43</A><DD>And he straitly charged him, and forthwith sent him away;
<DT><A NAME="1:44">1:44</A><DD>And saith unto him, <FONT CLASS=r>See thou say nothing to any man: but go thy way, shew thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing those things which Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.</FONT>
<DT><A NAME="1:45">1:45</A><DD>But he went out, and began to publish <I>it</I> much, and to blaze abroad the matter, insomuch that Jesus could no more openly enter into the city, but was without in desert places: and they came to him from every quarter.
</DL></DIV><H2>Chapter 2</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="2:1">2:1</A><DD>And again he entered into Capernaum after <I>some</I> days; and it was noised that he was in the house.
<DT><A NAME="2:2">2:2</A><DD>And straightway many were gathered together, insomuch that there was no room to receive <I>them</I>, no, not so much as about the door: and he preached the word unto them.
<DT><A NAME="2:3">2:3</A><DD>And they come unto him, bringing one sick of the palsy, which was borne of four.
<DT><A NAME="2:4">2:4</A><DD>And when they could not come nigh unto him for the press, they uncovered the roof where he was: and when they had broken <I>it</I> up, they let down the bed wherein the sick of the palsy lay.
<DT><A NAME="2:5">2:5</A><DD>When Jesus saw their faith, he said unto the sick of the palsy, <FONT CLASS=r>Son, thy sins be forgiven thee.</FONT>
<DT><A NAME="2:6">2:6</A><DD>But there were certain of the scribes sitting there, and reasoning in their hearts,
<DT><A NAME="2:7">2:7</A><DD>Why doth this <I>man</I> thus speak blasphemies? who can forgive sins but God only?
<DT><A NAME="2:8">2:8</A><DD>And immediately when Jesus perceived in his spirit that they so reasoned within themselves, he said unto them, <FONT CLASS=r>Why reason ye these things in your hearts?</FONT>
<DT><A NAME="2:9">2:9</A><DD><FONT CLASS=r>Whether is it easier to say to the sick of the palsy, <I>Thy</I> sins be forgiven thee; or to say, Arise, and take up thy bed, and walk?</FONT>
<DT><A NAME="2:10">2:10</A><DD><FONT CLASS=r>But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins,</FONT> (he saith to the sick of the palsy,)
<DT><A NAME="2:11">2:11</A><DD><FONT CLASS=r>I say unto thee, Arise, and take up thy bed, and go thy way into thine house.</FONT>
<DT><A NAME="2:12">2:12</A><DD>And immediately he arose, took up the bed, and went forth before them all; insomuch that they were all amazed, and glorified God, saying, We never saw it on this fashion.
<DT><A NAME="2:13">2:13</A><DD>And he went forth again by the sea side; and all the multitude resorted unto him, and he taught them.
<DT><A NAME="2:14">2:14</A><DD>And as he passed by, he saw Levi the <I>son</I> of Alphaeus sitting at the receipt of custom, and said unto him, <FONT CLASS=r>Follow me.</FONT> And he arose and followed him.
<DT><A NAME="2:15">2:15</A><DD>And it came to pass, that, as Jesus sat at meat in his house, many publicans and sinners sat also together with Jesus and his disciples: for there were many, and they followed him.
<DT><A NAME="2:16">2:16</A><DD>And when the scribes and Pharisees saw him eat with publicans and sinners, they said unto his disciples, How is it that he eateth and drinketh with publicans and sinners?
<DT><A NAME="2:17">2:17</A><DD>When Jesus heard <I>it</I>, he saith unto them, <FONT CLASS=r>They that are whole have no need of the physician, but they that are sick: I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.</FONT>
<DT><A NAME="2:18">2:18</A><DD>And the disciples of John and of the Pharisees used to fast: and they come and say unto him, Why do the disciples of John and of the Pharisees fast, but thy disciples fast not?
<DT><A NAME="2:19">2:19</A><DD>And Jesus said unto them, <FONT CLASS=r>Can the children of the bridechamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them? as long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast.</FONT>
<DT><A NAME="2:20">2:20</A><DD><FONT CLASS=r>But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then shall they fast in those days.</FONT>
<DT><A NAME="2:21">2:21</A><DD><FONT CLASS=r>No man also seweth a piece of new cloth on an old garment: else the new piece that filled it up taketh away from the old, and the rent is made worse.</FONT>
<DT><A NAME="2:22">2:22</A><DD><FONT CLASS=r>And no man putteth new wine into old bottles: else the new wine doth burst the bottles, and the wine is spilled, and the bottles will be marred: but new wine must be put into new bottles.</FONT>
<DT><A NAME="2:23">2:23</A><DD>And it came to pass, that he went through the corn fields on the sabbath day; and his disciples began, as they went, to pluck the ears of corn.
<DT><A NAME="2:24">2:24</A><DD>And the Pharisees said unto him, Behold, why do they on the sabbath day that which is not lawful?
<DT><A NAME="2:25">2:25</A><DD>And he said unto them, <FONT CLASS=r>Have ye never read what David did, when he had need, and was an hungred, he, and they that were with him?</FONT>
<DT><A NAME="2:26">2:26</A><DD><FONT CLASS=r>How he went into the house of God in the days of Abiathar the high priest, and did eat the shewbread, which is not lawful to eat but for the priests, and gave also to them which were with him?</FONT>
<DT><A NAME="2:27">2:27</A><DD>And he said unto them, <FONT CLASS=r>The sabbath was made for man, and not man for the sabbath:</FONT>
<DT><A NAME="2:28">2:28</A><DD><FONT CLASS=r>Therefore the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath.</FONT>
</DL></DIV><H2>Chapter 3</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="3:1">3:1</A><DD>And he entered again into the synagogue; and there was a man there which had a withered hand.
<DT><A NAME="3:2">3:2</A><DD>And they watched him, whether he would heal him on the sabbath day; that they might accuse him.
<DT><A NAME="3:3">3:3</A><DD>And he saith unto the man which had the withered hand, <FONT CLASS=r>Stand forth.</FONT>
<DT><A NAME="3:4">3:4</A><DD>And he saith unto them, <FONT CLASS=r>Is it lawful to do good on the sabbath days, or to do evil? to save life, or to kill?</FONT> But they held their peace.
<DT><A NAME="3:5">3:5</A><DD>And when he had looked round about on them with anger, being grieved for the hardness of their hearts, he saith unto the man, <FONT CLASS=r>Stretch forth thine hand.</FONT> And he stretched <I>it</I> out: and his hand was restored whole as the other.
<DT><A NAME="3:6">3:6</A><DD>And the Pharisees went forth, and straightway took counsel with the Herodians against him, how they might destroy him.
<DT><A NAME="3:7">3:7</A><DD>But Jesus withdrew himself with his disciples to the sea: and a great multitude from Galilee followed him, and from Judaea,
<DT><A NAME="3:8">3:8</A><DD>And from Jerusalem, and from Idumaea, and <I>from</I> beyond Jordan; and they about Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, when they had heard what great things he did, came unto him.
<DT><A NAME="3:9">3:9</A><DD>And he spake to his disciples, that a small ship should wait on him because of the multitude, lest they should throng him.
<DT><A NAME="3:10">3:10</A><DD>For he had healed many; insomuch that they pressed upon him for to touch him, as many as had plagues.
<DT><A NAME="3:11">3:11</A><DD>And unclean spirits, when they saw him, fell down before him, and cried, saying, Thou art the Son of God.
<DT><A NAME="3:12">3:12</A><DD>And he straitly charged them that they should not make him known.
<DT><A NAME="3:13">3:13</A><DD>And he goeth up into a mountain, and calleth <I>unto him</I> whom he would: and they came unto him.
<DT><A NAME="3:14">3:14</A><DD>And he ordained twelve, that they should be with him, and that he might send them forth to preach,
<DT><A NAME="3:15">3:15</A><DD>And to have power to heal sicknesses, and to cast out devils:
<DT><A NAME="3:16">3:16</A><DD>And Simon he surnamed Peter;
<DT><A NAME="3:17">3:17</A><DD>And James the <I>son</I> of Zebedee, and John the brother of James; and he surnamed them Boanerges, which is, The sons of thunder:
<DT><A NAME="3:18">3:18</A><DD>And Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the <I>son</I> of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, and Simon the Canaanite,
<DT><A NAME="3:19">3:19</A><DD>And Judas Iscariot, which also betrayed him: and they went into an house.
<DT><A NAME="3:20">3:20</A><DD>And the multitude cometh together again, so that they could not so much as eat bread.
<DT><A NAME="3:21">3:21</A><DD>And when his friends heard <I>of it</I>, they went out to lay hold on him: for they said, He is beside himself.
<DT><A NAME="3:22">3:22</A><DD>And the scribes which came down from Jerusalem said, He hath Beelzebub, and by the prince of the devils casteth he out devils.
<DT><A NAME="3:23">3:23</A><DD>And he called them <I>unto him</I>, and said unto them in parables, <FONT CLASS=r>How can Satan cast out Satan?</FONT>
<DT><A NAME="3:24">3:24</A><DD><FONT CLASS=r>And if a kingdom be divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.</FONT>
<DT><A NAME="3:25">3:25</A><DD><FONT CLASS=r>And if a house be divided against itself, that house cannot stand.</FONT>
<DT><A NAME="3:26">3:26</A><DD><FONT CLASS=r>And if Satan rise up against himself, and be divided, he cannot stand, but hath an end.</FONT>
<DT><A NAME="3:27">3:27</A><DD><FONT CLASS=r>No man can enter into a strong man's house, and spoil his goods, except he will first bind the strong man; and then he will spoil his house.</FONT>
<DT><A NAME="3:28">3:28</A><DD><FONT CLASS=r>Verily I say unto you, All sins shall be forgiven unto the sons of men, and blasphemies wherewith soever they shall blaspheme:</FONT>
<DT><A NAME="3:29">3:29</A><DD><FONT CLASS=r>But he that shall blaspheme against the Holy Ghost hath never forgiveness, but is in danger of eternal damnation:</FONT>
<DT><A NAME="3:30">3:30</A><DD>Because they said, He hath an unclean spirit.
<DT><A NAME="3:31">3:31</A><DD>There came then his brethren and his mother, and, standing without, sent unto him, calling him.
<DT><A NAME="3:32">3:32</A><DD>And the multitude sat about him, and they said unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren without seek for thee.
<DT><A NAME="3:33">3:33</A><DD>And he answered them, saying, <FONT CLASS=r>Who is my mother, or my brethren?</FONT>
<DT><A NAME="3:34">3:34</A><DD>And he looked round about on them which sat about him, and said, <FONT CLASS=r>Behold my mother and my brethren!</FONT>
<DT><A NAME="3:35">3:35</A><DD><FONT CLASS=r>For whosoever shall do the will of God, the same is my brother, and my sister, and mother.</FONT>
</DL></DIV><H2>Chapter 4</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="4:1">4:1</A><DD>And he began again to teach by the sea side: and there was gathered unto him a great multitude, so that he entered into a ship, and sat in the sea; and the whole multitude was by the sea on the land.
<DT><A NAME="4:2">4:2</A><DD>And he taught them many things by parables, and said unto them in his doctrine,
<DT><A NAME="4:3">4:3</A><DD><FONT CLASS=r>Hearken; Behold, there went out a sower to sow:</FONT>
<DT><A NAME="4:4">4:4</A><DD><FONT CLASS=r>And it came to pass, as he sowed, some fell by the way side, and the fowls of the air came and devoured it up.</FONT>
<DT><A NAME="4:5">4:5</A><DD><FONT CLASS=r>And some fell on stony ground, where it had not much earth; and immediately it sprang up, because it had no depth of earth:</FONT>
<DT><A NAME="4:6">4:6</A><DD><FONT CLASS=r>But when the sun was up, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered away.</FONT>
<DT><A NAME="4:7">4:7</A><DD><FONT CLASS=r>And some fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up, and choked it, and it yielded no fruit.</FONT>
<DT><A NAME="4:8">4:8</A><DD><FONT CLASS=r>And other fell on good ground, and did yield fruit that sprang up and increased; and brought forth, some thirty, and some sixty, and some an hundred.</FONT>
<DT><A NAME="4:9">4:9</A><DD>And he said unto them, <FONT CLASS=r>He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.</FONT>
<DT><A NAME="4:10">4:10</A><DD>And when he was alone, they that were about him with the twelve asked of him the parable.
<DT><A NAME="4:11">4:11</A><DD>And he said unto them, <FONT CLASS=r>Unto you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God: but unto them that are without, all <I>these</I> things are done in parables:</FONT>

<DT><A NAME="4:14">4:14</A><DD><FONT CLASS=r>The sower soweth the word.</FONT>
<DT><A NAME="4:15">4:15</A><DD><FONT CLASS=r>And these are they by the way side, where the word is sown; but when they have heard, Satan cometh immediately, and taketh away the word that was sown in their hearts.</FONT>

<DT><A NAME="6:3">6:3</A><DD>Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, the brother of James, and Joses, and of Juda, and Simon? and are not his sisters here with us? And they were offended at him.

<DT><A NAME="6:17">6:17</A><DD>For Herod himself had sent forth and laid hold upon John, and bound him in prison for Herodias' sake, his brother Philip's wife: for he had married her.
<DT><A NAME="6:18">6:18</A><DD>For John had said unto Herod, It is not lawful for thee to have thy brother's wife.
<DT><A NAME="6:19">6:19</A><DD>Therefore Herodias had a quarrel against him, and would have killed him; but she could not:
<DT><A NAME="6:20">6:20</A><DD>For Herod feared John, knowing that he was a just man and an holy, and observed him; and when he heard him, he did many things, and heard him gladly.

<DT><A NAME="6:26">6:26</A><DD>And the king was exceeding sorry; <I>yet</I> for his oath's sake, and for their sakes which sat with him, he would not reject her.
<DT><A NAME="6:27">6:27</A><DD>And immediately the king sent an executioner, and commanded his head to be brought: and he went and beheaded him in the prison,

<DT><A NAME="6:29">6:29</A><DD>And when his disciples heard <I>of it</I>, they came and took up his corpse, and laid it in a tomb.

<DT><A NAME="6:51">6:51</A><DD>And he went up unto them into the ship; and the wind ceased: and they were sore amazed in themselves beyond measure, and wondered.
<DT><A NAME="6:52">6:52</A><DD>For they considered not <I>the miracle</I> of the loaves: for their heart was hardened.
<DT><A NAME="6:53">6:53</A><DD>And when they had passed over, they came into the land of Gennesaret, and drew to the shore.
<DT><A NAME="6:54">6:54</A><DD>And when they were come out of the ship, straightway they knew him,

<DT><A NAME="6:56">6:56</A><DD>And whithersoever he entered, into villages, or cities, or country, they laid the sick in the streets, and besought him that they might touch if it were but the border of his garment: and as many as touched him were made whole.

<DT><A NAME="14:18">14:18</A><DD>And as they sat and did eat, Jesus said, <FONT CLASS=r>Verily I say unto you, One of you which eateth with me shall betray me.</FONT>
<DT><A NAME="14:19">14:19</A><DD>And they began to be sorrowful, and to say unto him one by one, <I>Is</I> it I? and another <I>said, Is</I> it I?
<DT><A NAME="14:20">14:20</A><DD>And he answered and said unto them, <FONT CLASS=r><I>It is</I> one of the twelve, that dippeth with me in the dish.</FONT>

<DT><A NAME="14:22">14:22</A><DD>And as they did eat, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and brake <I>it</I>, and gave to them, and said, <FONT CLASS=r>Take, eat: this is my body.</FONT>
<DT><A NAME="14:23">14:23</A><DD>And he took the cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave <I>it</I> to them: and they all drank of it.
<DT><A NAME="14:24">14:24</A><DD>And he said unto them, <FONT CLASS=r>This is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many.</FONT>
<DT><A NAME="14:25">14:25</A><DD><FONT CLASS=r>Verily I say unto you, I will drink no more of the fruit of the vine, until that day that I drink it new in the kingdom of God.</FONT>
<DT><A NAME="14:26">14:26</A><DD>And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives.
<DT><A NAME="14:27">14:27</A><DD>And Jesus saith unto them, <FONT CLASS=r>All ye shall be offended because of me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered.</FONT>
<DT><A NAME="14:28">14:28</A><DD><FONT CLASS=r>But after that I am risen, I will go before you into Galilee.</FONT>
<DT><A NAME="14:29">14:29</A><DD>But Peter said unto him, Although all shall be offended, yet <I>will</I> not I.

<DT><A NAME="14:31">14:31</A><DD>But he spake the more vehemently, If I should die with thee, I will not deny thee in any wise. Likewise also said they all.
<DT><A NAME="14:32">14:32</A><DD>And they came to a place which was named Gethsemane: and he saith to his disciples, <FONT CLASS=r>Sit ye here, while I shall pray.</FONT>
<DT><A NAME="14:33">14:33</A><DD>And he taketh with him Peter and James and John, and began to be sore amazed, and to be very heavy;
<DT><A NAME="14:34">14:34</A><DD>And saith unto them, <FONT CLASS=r>My soul is exceeding sorrowful unto death: tarry ye here, and watch.</FONT>
<DT><A NAME="14:35">14:35</A><DD>And he went forward a little, and fell on the ground, and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass from him.
<DT><A NAME="14:36">14:36</A><DD>And he said, <FONT CLASS=r>Abba, Father, all things <I>are</I> possible unto thee; take away this cup from me: nevertheless not what I will, but what thou wilt.</FONT>
<DT><A NAME="14:37">14:37</A><DD>And he cometh, and findeth them sleeping, and saith unto Peter, <FONT CLASS=r>Simon, sleepest thou? couldest not thou watch one hour?</FONT>

<DT><A NAME="14:39">14:39</A><DD>And again he went away, and prayed, and spake the same words.
<DT><A NAME="14:40">14:40</A><DD>And when he returned, he found them asleep again, (for their eyes were heavy,) neither wist they what to answer him.
<DT><A NAME="14:41">14:41</A><DD>And he cometh the third time, and saith unto them, <FONT CLASS=r>Sleep on now, and take <I>your</I> rest: it is enough, the hour is come; behold, the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.</FONT>
<DT><A NAME="14:42">14:42</A><DD><FONT CLASS=r>Rise up, let us go; lo, he that betrayeth me is at hand.</FONT>
<DT><A NAME="14:43">14:43</A><DD>And immediately, while he yet spake, cometh Judas, one of the twelve, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders.
<DT><A NAME="14:44">14:44</A><DD>And he that betrayed him had given them a token, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he; take him, and lead <I>him</I> away safely.
<DT><A NAME="14:45">14:45</A><DD>And as soon as he was come, he goeth straightway to him, and saith, Master, master; and kissed him.
<DT><A NAME="14:46">14:46</A><DD>And they laid their hands on him, and took him.
<DT><A NAME="14:47">14:47</A><DD>And one of them that stood by drew a sword, and smote a servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear.
<DT><A NAME="14:48">14:48</A><DD>And Jesus answered and said unto them, <FONT CLASS=r>Are ye come out, as against a thief, with swords and <I>with</I> staves to take me?</FONT>
<DT><A NAME="14:49">14:49</A><DD><FONT CLASS=r>I was daily with you in the temple teaching, and ye took me not: but the scriptures must be fulfilled.</FONT>
<DT><A NAME="14:50">14:50</A><DD>And they all forsook him, and fled.
<DT><A NAME="14:51">14:51</A><DD>And there followed him a certain young man, having a linen cloth cast about <I>his</I> naked <I>body</I>; and the young men laid hold on him:
<DT><A NAME="14:52">14:52</A><DD>And he left the linen cloth, and fled from them naked.
<DT><A NAME="14:53">14:53</A><DD>And they led Jesus away to the high priest: and with him were assembled all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes.
<DT><A NAME="14:54">14:54</A><DD>And Peter followed him afar off, even into the palace of the high priest: and he sat with the servants, and warmed himself at the fire.
<DT><A NAME="14:55">14:55</A><DD>And the chief priests and all the council sought for witness against Jesus to put him to death; and found none.
<DT><A NAME="14:56">14:56</A><DD>For many bare false witness against him, but their witness agreed not together.
<DT><A NAME="14:57">14:57</A><DD>And there arose certain, and bare false witness against him, saying,
<DT><A NAME="14:58">14:58</A><DD>We heard him say, I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and within three days I will build another made without hands.
<DT><A NAME="14:59">14:59</A><DD>But neither so did their witness agree together.
<DT><A NAME="14:60">14:60</A><DD>And the high priest stood up in the midst, and asked Jesus, saying, Answerest thou nothing? what <I>is it which</I> these witness against thee?
<DT><A NAME="14:61">14:61</A><DD>But he held his peace, and answered nothing. Again the high priest asked him, and said unto him, Art thou the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?
<DT><A NAME="14:62">14:62</A><DD>And Jesus said, <FONT CLASS=r>I am: and ye shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.</FONT>
<DT><A NAME="14:63">14:63</A><DD>Then the high priest rent his clothes, and saith, What need we any further witnesses?
<DT><A NAME="14:64">14:64</A><DD>Ye have heard the blasphemy: what think ye? And they all condemned him to be guilty of death.
<DT><A NAME="14:65">14:65</A><DD>And some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to buffet him, and to say unto him, Prophesy: and the servants did strike him with the palms of their hands.
<DT><A NAME="14:66">14:66</A><DD>And as Peter was beneath in the palace, there cometh one of the maids of the high priest:
<DT><A NAME="14:67">14:67</A><DD>And when she saw Peter warming himself, she looked upon him, and said, And thou also wast with Jesus of Nazareth.
<DT><A NAME="14:68">14:68</A><DD>But he denied, saying, I know not, neither understand I what thou sayest. And he went out into the porch; and the cock crew.
<DT><A NAME="14:69">14:69</A><DD>And a maid saw him again, and began to say to them that stood by, This is <I>one</I> of them.
<DT><A NAME="14:70">14:70</A><DD>And he denied it again. And a little after, they that stood by said again to Peter, Surely thou art <I>one</I> of them: for thou art a Galilaean, and thy speech agreeth <I>thereto</I>.
<DT><A NAME="14:71">14:71</A><DD>But he began to curse and to swear, <I>saying</I>, I know not this man of whom ye speak.
<DT><A NAME="14:72">14:72</A><DD>And the second time the cock crew. And Peter called to mind the word that Jesus said unto him, Before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice. And when he thought thereon, he wept.

<DT><A NAME="15:1">15:1</A><DD>And straightway in the morning the chief priests held a consultation with the elders and scribes and the whole council, and bound Jesus, and carried <I>him</I> away, and delivered <I>him</I> to Pilate.
<DT><A NAME="15:2">15:2</A><DD>And Pilate asked him, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answering said unto him, <FONT CLASS=r>Thou sayest <I>it</I>.</FONT>
<DT><A NAME="15:3">15:3</A><DD>And the chief priests accused him of many things: but he answered nothing.
<DT><A NAME="15:4">15:4</A><DD>And Pilate asked him again, saying, Answerest thou nothing? behold how many things they witness against thee.
<DT><A NAME="15:5">15:5</A><DD>But Jesus yet answered nothing; so that Pilate marvelled.
<DT><A NAME="15:6">15:6</A><DD>Now at <I>that</I> feast he released unto them one prisoner, whomsoever they desired.
<DT><A NAME="15:7">15:7</A><DD>And there was <I>one</I> named Barabbas, <I>which lay</I> bound with them that had made insurrection with him, who had committed murder in the insurrection.
<DT><A NAME="15:8">15:8</A><DD>And the multitude crying aloud began to desire <I>him to do</I> as he had ever done unto them.
<DT><A NAME="15:9">15:9</A><DD>But Pilate answered them, saying, Will ye that I release unto you the King of the Jews?
<DT><A NAME="15:10">15:10</A><DD>For he knew that the chief priests had delivered him for envy.
<DT><A NAME="15:11">15:11</A><DD>But the chief priests moved the people, that he should rather release Barabbas unto them.
<DT><A NAME="15:12">15:12</A><DD>And Pilate answered and said again unto them, What will ye then that I shall do <I>unto him</I> whom ye call the King of the Jews?
<DT><A NAME="15:13">15:13</A><DD>And they cried out again, Crucify him.
<DT><A NAME="15:14">15:14</A><DD>Then Pilate said unto them, Why, what evil hath he done? And they cried out the more exceedingly, Crucify him.
<DT><A NAME="15:15">15:15</A><DD>And <I>so</I> Pilate, willing to content the people, released Barabbas unto them, and delivered Jesus, when he had scourged <I>him</I>, to be crucified.
<DT><A NAME="15:16">15:16</A><DD>And the soldiers led him away into the hall, called Praetorium; and they call together the whole band.
<DT><A NAME="15:17">15:17</A><DD>And they clothed him with purple, and platted a crown of thorns, and put it about his <I>head</I>,
<DT><A NAME="15:18">15:18</A><DD>And began to salute him, Hail, King of the Jews!
<DT><A NAME="15:19">15:19</A><DD>And they smote him on the head with a reed, and did spit upon him, and bowing <I>their</I> knees worshipped him.
<DT><A NAME="15:20">15:20</A><DD>And when they had mocked him, they took off the purple from him, and put his own clothes on him, and led him out to crucify him.
<DT><A NAME="15:21">15:21</A><DD>And they compel one Simon a Cyrenian, who passed by, coming out of the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to bear his cross.
<DT><A NAME="15:22">15:22</A><DD>And they bring him unto the place Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, The place of a skull.
<DT><A NAME="15:23">15:23</A><DD>And they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh: but he received <I>it</I> not.
<DT><A NAME="15:24">15:24</A><DD>And when they had crucified him, they parted his garments, casting lots upon them, what every man should take.
<DT><A NAME="15:25">15:25</A><DD>And it was the third hour, and they crucified him.
<DT><A NAME="15:26">15:26</A><DD>And the superscription of his accusation was written over, THE KING OF THE JEWS.
<DT><A NAME="15:27">15:27</A><DD>And with him they crucify two thieves; the one on his right hand, and the other on his left.
<DT><A NAME="15:28">15:28</A><DD>And the scripture was fulfilled, which saith, And he was numbered with the transgressors.
<DT><A NAME="15:29">15:29</A><DD>And they that passed by railed on him, wagging their heads, and saying, Ah, thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest <I>it</I> in three days,
<DT><A NAME="15:30">15:30</A><DD>Save thyself, and come down from the cross.
<DT><A NAME="15:31">15:31</A><DD>Likewise also the chief priests mocking said among themselves with the scribes, He saved others; himself he cannot save.
<DT><A NAME="15:32">15:32</A><DD>Let Christ the King of Israel descend now from the cross, that we may see and believe. And they that were crucified with him reviled him.
<DT><A NAME="15:33">15:33</A><DD>And when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour.
<DT><A NAME="15:34">15:34</A><DD>And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, <FONT CLASS=r>Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?</FONT> which is, being interpreted, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?
<DT><A NAME="15:35">15:35</A><DD>And some of them that stood by, when they heard <I>it</I>, said, Behold, he calleth Elias.
<DT><A NAME="15:36">15:36</A><DD>And one ran and filled a spunge full of vinegar, and put <I>it</I> on a reed, and gave him to drink, saying, Let alone; let us see whether Elias will come to take him down.
<DT><A NAME="15:37">15:37</A><DD>And Jesus cried with a loud voice, and gave up the ghost.
<DT><A NAME="15:38">15:38</A><DD>And the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom.
<DT><A NAME="15:39">15:39</A><DD>And when the centurion, which stood over against him, saw that he so cried out, and gave up the ghost, he said, Truly this man was the Son of God.
<DT><A NAME="15:40">15:40</A><DD>There were also women looking on afar off: among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and Salome;

<DT><A NAME="15:43">15:43</A><DD>Joseph of Arimathaea, an honourable counsellor, which also waited for the kingdom of God, came, and went in boldly unto Pilate, and craved the body of Jesus.
<DT><A NAME="15:44">15:44</A><DD>And Pilate marvelled if he were already dead: and calling <I>unto him</I> the centurion, he asked him whether he had been any while dead.
<DT><A NAME="15:45">15:45</A><DD>And when he knew <I>it</I> of the centurion, he gave the body to Joseph.
<DT><A NAME="15:46">15:46</A><DD>And he bought fine linen, and took him down, and wrapped him in the linen, and laid him in a sepulchre which was hewn out of a rock, and rolled a stone unto the door of the sepulchre.
<DT><A NAME="15:47">15:47</A><DD>And Mary Magdalene and Mary <I>the mother</I> of Joses beheld where he was laid.

<DT><A NAME="16:1">16:1</A><DD>And when the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the <I>mother</I> of James, and Salome, had bought sweet spices, that they might come and anoint him.
<DT><A NAME="16:2">16:2</A><DD>And very early in the morning the first <I>day</I> of the week, they came unto the sepulchre at the rising of the sun.
<DT><A NAME="16:3">16:3</A><DD>And they said among themselves, Who shall roll us away the stone from the door of the sepulchre?
<DT><A NAME="16:4">16:4</A><DD>And when they looked, they saw that the stone was rolled away: for it was very great.
<DT><A NAME="16:5">16:5</A><DD>And entering into the sepulchre, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, clothed in a long white garment; and they were affrighted.
<DT><A NAME="16:6">16:6</A><DD>And he saith unto them, Be not affrighted: Ye seek Jesus of Nazareth, which was crucified: he is risen; he is not here: behold the place where they laid him.
<DT><A NAME="16:7">16:7</A><DD>But go your way, tell his disciples and Peter that he goeth before you into Galilee: there shall ye see him, as he said unto you.
<DT><A NAME="16:8">16:8</A><DD>And they went out quickly, and fled from the sepulchre; for they trembled and were amazed: neither said they any thing to any <I>man</I>; for they were afraid.
<DT><A NAME="16:9">16:9</A><DD>Now when <I>Jesus</I> was risen early the first <I>day</I> of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom he had cast seven devils.

<DT><A NAME="16:11">16:11</A><DD>And they, when they had heard that he was alive, and had been seen of her, believed not.
<DT><A NAME="16:12">16:12</A><DD>After that he appeared in another form unto two of them, as they walked, and went into the country.

<DT><A NAME="16:14">16:14</A><DD>Afterward he appeared unto the eleven as they sat at meat, and upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they believed not them which had seen him after he was risen.
<DT><A NAME="16:15">16:15</A><DD>And he said unto them, <FONT CLASS=r>Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.</FONT>
