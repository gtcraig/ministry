<H2>Chapter 1</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="1:1">1:1</A><DD>The words of Nehemiah the son of Hachaliah. And it came to pass in the month Chisleu, in the twentieth year, as I was in Shushan the palace,
<DT><A NAME="1:2">1:2</A><DD>That Hanani, one of my brethren, came, he and <I>certain</I> men of Judah; and I asked them concerning the Jews that had escaped, which were left of the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem.
<DT><A NAME="1:3">1:3</A><DD>And they said unto me, The remnant that are left of the captivity there in the province <I>are</I> in great affliction and reproach: the wall of Jerusalem also <I>is</I> broken down, and the gates thereof are burned with fire.
<DT><A NAME="1:4">1:4</A><DD>And it came to pass, when I heard these words, that I sat down and wept, and mourned <I>certain</I> days, and fasted, and prayed before the God of heaven,
<DT><A NAME="1:5">1:5</A><DD>And said, I beseech thee, O LORD God of heaven, the great and terrible God, that keepeth covenant and mercy for them that love him and observe his commandments:
<DT><A NAME="1:6">1:6</A><DD>Let thine ear now be attentive, and thine eyes open, that thou mayest hear the prayer of thy servant, which I pray before thee now, day and night, for the children of Israel thy servants, and confess the sins of the children of Israel, which we have sinned against thee: both I and my father's house have sinned.
<DT><A NAME="1:7">1:7</A><DD>We have dealt very corruptly against thee, and have not kept the commandments, nor the statutes, nor the judgments, which thou commandedst thy servant Moses.
<DT><A NAME="1:8">1:8</A><DD>Remember, I beseech thee, the word that thou commandedst thy servant Moses, saying, <I>If</I> ye transgress, I will scatter you abroad among the nations:
<DT><A NAME="1:9">1:9</A><DD>But <I>if</I> ye turn unto me, and keep my commandments, and do them; though there were of you cast out unto the uttermost part of the heaven, <I>yet</I> will I gather them from thence, and will bring them unto the place that I have chosen to set my name there.
<DT><A NAME="1:10">1:10</A><DD>Now these <I>are</I> thy servants and thy people, whom thou hast redeemed by thy great power, and by thy strong hand.
<DT><A NAME="1:11">1:11</A><DD>O Lord, I beseech thee, let now thine ear be attentive to the prayer of thy servant, and to the prayer of thy servants, who desire to fear thy name: and prosper, I pray thee, thy servant this day, and grant him mercy in the sight of this man. For I was the king's cupbearer.
</DL></DIV><H2>Chapter 2</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="2:1">2:1</A><DD>And it came to pass in the month Nisan, in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes the king, <I>that</I> wine <I>was</I> before him: and I took up the wine, and gave <I>it</I> unto the king. Now I had not been <I>beforetime</I> sad in his presence.
<DT><A NAME="2:2">2:2</A><DD>Wherefore the king said unto me, Why <I>is</I> thy countenance sad, seeing thou <I>art</I> not sick? this <I>is</I> nothing <I>else</I> but sorrow of heart. Then I was very sore afraid,
<DT><A NAME="2:3">2:3</A><DD>And said unto the king, Let the king live for ever: why should not my countenance be sad, when the city, the place of my fathers' sepulchres, <I>lieth</I> waste, and the gates thereof are consumed with fire?
<DT><A NAME="2:4">2:4</A><DD>Then the king said unto me, For what dost thou make request? So I prayed to the God of heaven.
<DT><A NAME="2:5">2:5</A><DD>And I said unto the king, If it please the king, and if thy servant have found favour in thy sight, that thou wouldest send me unto Judah, unto the city of my fathers' sepulchres, that I may build it.
<DT><A NAME="2:6">2:6</A><DD>And the king said unto me, (the queen also sitting by him,) For how long shall thy journey be? and when wilt thou return? So it pleased the king to send me; and I set him a time.
<DT><A NAME="2:7">2:7</A><DD>Moreover I said unto the king, If it please the king, let letters be given me to the governors beyond the river, that they may convey me over till I come into Judah;
<DT><A NAME="2:8">2:8</A><DD>And a letter unto Asaph the keeper of the king's forest, that he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of the palace which <I>appertained</I> to the house, and for the wall of the city, and for the house that I shall enter into. And the king granted me, according to the good hand of my God upon me.
<DT><A NAME="2:9">2:9</A><DD>Then I came to the governors beyond the river, and gave them the king's letters. Now the king had sent captains of the army and horsemen with me.
<DT><A NAME="2:10">2:10</A><DD>When Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, heard <I>of it</I>, it grieved them exceedingly that there was come a man to seek the welfare of the children of Israel.
<DT><A NAME="2:11">2:11</A><DD>So I came to Jerusalem, and was there three days.
<DT><A NAME="2:12">2:12</A><DD>And I arose in the night, I and some few men with me; neither told I <I>any</I> man what my God had put in my heart to do at Jerusalem: neither <I>was there any</I> beast with me, save the beast that I rode upon.
<DT><A NAME="2:13">2:13</A><DD>And I went out by night by the gate of the valley, even before the dragon well, and to the dung port, and viewed the walls of Jerusalem, which were broken down, and the gates thereof were consumed with fire.
<DT><A NAME="2:14">2:14</A><DD>Then I went on to the gate of the fountain, and to the king's pool: but <I>there was</I> no place for the beast <I>that was</I> under me to pass.
<DT><A NAME="2:15">2:15</A><DD>Then went I up in the night by the brook, and viewed the wall, and turned back, and entered by the gate of the valley, and <I>so</I> returned.
<DT><A NAME="2:16">2:16</A><DD>And the rulers knew not whither I went, or what I did; neither had I as yet told <I>it</I> to the Jews, nor to the priests, nor to the nobles, nor to the rulers, nor to the rest that did the work.
<DT><A NAME="2:17">2:17</A><DD>Then said I unto them, Ye see the distress that we <I>are</I> in, how Jerusalem <I>lieth</I> waste, and the gates thereof are burned with fire: come, and let us build up the wall of Jerusalem, that we be no more a reproach.
<DT><A NAME="2:18">2:18</A><DD>Then I told them of the hand of my God which was good upon me; as also the king's words that he had spoken unto me. And they said, Let us rise up and build. So they strengthened their hands for <I>this</I> good <I>work</I>.
<DT><A NAME="2:19">2:19</A><DD>But when Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, and Geshem the Arabian, heard <I>it</I>, they laughed us to scorn, and despised us, and said, What <I>is</I> this thing that ye do? will ye rebel against the king?
<DT><A NAME="2:20">2:20</A><DD>Then answered I them, and said unto them, The God of heaven, he will prosper us; therefore we his servants will arise and build: but ye have no portion, nor right, nor memorial, in Jerusalem.
</DL></DIV><H2>Chapter 3</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="3:1">3:1</A><DD>Then Eliashib the high priest rose up with his brethren the priests, and they builded the sheep gate; they sanctified it, and set up the doors of it; even unto the tower of Meah they sanctified it, unto the tower of Hananeel.
<DT><A NAME="3:2">3:2</A><DD>And next unto him builded the men of Jericho. And next to them builded Zaccur the son of Imri.

</DL></DIV><H2>Chapter 4</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="4:1">4:1</A><DD>But it came to pass, that when Sanballat heard that we builded the wall, he was wroth, and took great indignation, and mocked the Jews.
<DT><A NAME="4:2">4:2</A><DD>And he spake before his brethren and the army of Samaria, and said, What do these feeble Jews? will they fortify themselves? will they sacrifice? will they make an end in a day? will they revive the stones out of the heaps of the rubbish which are burned?
<DT><A NAME="4:3">4:3</A><DD>Now Tobiah the Ammonite <I>was</I> by him, and he said, Even that which they build, if a fox go up, he shall even break down their stone wall.
<DT><A NAME="4:4">4:4</A><DD>Hear, O our God; for we are despised: and turn their reproach upon their own head, and give them for a prey in the land of captivity:
<DT><A NAME="4:5">4:5</A><DD>And cover not their iniquity, and let not their sin be blotted out from before thee: for they have provoked <I>thee</I> to anger before the builders.
<DT><A NAME="4:6">4:6</A><DD>So built we the wall; and all the wall was joined together unto the half thereof: for the people had a mind to work.
<DT><A NAME="4:7">4:7</A><DD>But it came to pass, <I>that</I> when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and the Arabians, and the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites, heard that the walls of Jerusalem were made up, <I>and</I> that the breaches began to be stopped, then they were very wroth,
<DT><A NAME="4:8">4:8</A><DD>And conspired all of them together to come <I>and</I> to fight against Jerusalem, and to hinder it.
<DT><A NAME="4:9">4:9</A><DD>Nevertheless we made our prayer unto our God, and set a watch against them day and night, because of them.
<DT><A NAME="4:10">4:10</A><DD>And Judah said, The strength of the bearers of burdens is decayed, and <I>there is</I> much rubbish; so that we are not able to build the wall.
<DT><A NAME="4:11">4:11</A><DD>And our adversaries said, They shall not know, neither see, till we come in the midst among them, and slay them, and cause the work to cease.
<DT><A NAME="4:12">4:12</A><DD>And it came to pass, that when the Jews which dwelt by them came, they said unto us ten times, From all places whence ye shall return unto us <I>they will be upon you</I>.
<DT><A NAME="4:13">4:13</A><DD>Therefore set I in the lower places behind the wall, <I>and</I> on the higher places, I even set the people after their families with their swords, their spears, and their bows.
<DT><A NAME="4:14">4:14</A><DD>And I looked, and rose up, and said unto the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest of the people, Be not ye afraid of them: remember the Lord, <I>which is</I> great and terrible, and fight for your brethren, your sons, and your daughters, your wives, and your houses.
<DT><A NAME="4:15">4:15</A><DD>And it came to pass, when our enemies heard that it was known unto us, and God had brought their counsel to nought, that we returned all of us to the wall, every one unto his work.
<DT><A NAME="4:16">4:16</A><DD>And it came to pass from that time forth, <I>that</I> the half of my servants wrought in the work, and the other half of them held both the spears, the shields, and the bows, and the habergeons; and the rulers <I>were</I> behind all the house of Judah.
<DT><A NAME="4:17">4:17</A><DD>They which builded on the wall, and they that bare burdens, with those that laded, <I>every one</I> with one of his hands wrought in the work, and with the other <I>hand</I> held a weapon.
<DT><A NAME="4:18">4:18</A><DD>For the builders, every one had his sword girded by his side, and <I>so</I> builded. And he that sounded the trumpet <I>was</I> by me.
<DT><A NAME="4:19">4:19</A><DD>And I said unto the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest of the people, The work <I>is</I> great and large, and we are separated upon the wall, one far from another.
<DT><A NAME="4:20">4:20</A><DD>In what place <I>therefore</I> ye hear the sound of the trumpet, resort ye thither unto us: our God shall fight for us.
<DT><A NAME="4:21">4:21</A><DD>So we laboured in the work: and half of them held the spears from the rising of the morning till the stars appeared.
<DT><A NAME="4:22">4:22</A><DD>Likewise at the same time said I unto the people, Let every one with his servant lodge within Jerusalem, that in the night they may be a guard to us, and labour on the day.
<DT><A NAME="4:23">4:23</A><DD>So neither I, nor my brethren, nor my servants, nor the men of the guard which followed me, none of us put off our clothes, <I>saving that</I> every one put them off for washing.
</DL></DIV><H2>Chapter 5</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="5:1">5:1</A><DD>And there was a great cry of the people and of their wives against their brethren the Jews.
<DT><A NAME="5:2">5:2</A><DD>For there were that said, We, our sons, and our daughters, <I>are</I> many: therefore we take up corn <I>for them</I>, that we may eat, and live.
<DT><A NAME="5:3">5:3</A><DD><I>Some</I> also there were that said, We have mortgaged our lands, vineyards, and houses, that we might buy corn, because of the dearth.
<DT><A NAME="5:4">5:4</A><DD>There were also that said, We have borrowed money for the king's tribute, <I>and that upon</I> our lands and vineyards.
<DT><A NAME="5:5">5:5</A><DD>Yet now our flesh <I>is</I> as the flesh of our brethren, our children as their children: and, lo, we bring into bondage our sons and our daughters to be servants, and <I>some</I> of our daughters are brought unto bondage <I>already</I>: neither <I>is it</I> in our power <I>to redeem them</I>; for other men have our lands and vineyards.
<DT><A NAME="5:6">5:6</A><DD>And I was very angry when I heard their cry and these words.
<DT><A NAME="5:7">5:7</A><DD>Then I consulted with myself, and I rebuked the nobles, and the rulers, and said unto them, Ye exact usury, every one of his brother. And I set a great assembly against them.
<DT><A NAME="5:8">5:8</A><DD>And I said unto them, We after our ability have redeemed our brethren the Jews, which were sold unto the heathen; and will ye even sell your brethren? or shall they be sold unto us? Then held they their peace, and found nothing <I>to answer</I>.
<DT><A NAME="5:9">5:9</A><DD>Also I said, It <I>is</I> not good that ye do: ought ye not to walk in the fear of our God because of the reproach of the heathen our enemies?
<DT><A NAME="5:10">5:10</A><DD>I likewise, <I>and</I> my brethren, and my servants, might exact of them money and corn: I pray you, let us leave off this usury.
<DT><A NAME="5:11">5:11</A><DD>Restore, I pray you, to them, even this day, their lands, their vineyards, their oliveyards, and their houses, also the hundredth <I>part</I> of the money, and of the corn, the wine, and the oil, that ye exact of them.
<DT><A NAME="5:12">5:12</A><DD>Then said they, We will restore <I>them</I>, and will require nothing of them; so will we do as thou sayest. Then I called the priests, and took an oath of them, that they should do according to this promise.
<DT><A NAME="5:13">5:13</A><DD>Also I shook my lap, and said, So God shake out every man from his house, and from his labour, that performeth not this promise, even thus be he shaken out, and emptied. And all the congregation said, Amen, and praised the LORD. And the people did according to this promise.

<DT><A NAME="6:1">6:1</A><DD>Now it came to pass, when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and Geshem the Arabian, and the rest of our enemies, heard that I had builded the wall, and <I>that</I> there was no breach left therein; (though at that time I had not set up the doors upon the gates;)
<DT><A NAME="6:2">6:2</A><DD>That Sanballat and Geshem sent unto me, saying, Come, let us meet together in <I>some one of</I> the villages in the plain of Ono. But they thought to do me mischief.
<DT><A NAME="6:3">6:3</A><DD>And I sent messengers unto them, saying, I <I>am</I> doing a great work, so that I cannot come down: why should the work cease, whilst I leave it, and come down to you?
<DT><A NAME="6:4">6:4</A><DD>Yet they sent unto me four times after this sort; and I answered them after the same manner.
<DT><A NAME="6:5">6:5</A><DD>Then sent Sanballat his servant unto me in like manner the fifth time with an open letter in his hand;
<DT><A NAME="6:6">6:6</A><DD>Wherein <I>was</I> written, It is reported among the heathen, and Gashmu saith <I>it, that</I> thou and the Jews think to rebel: for which cause thou buildest the wall, that thou mayest be their king, according to these words.
<DT><A NAME="6:7">6:7</A><DD>And thou hast also appointed prophets to preach of thee at Jerusalem, saying, <I>There is</I> a king in Judah: and now shall it be reported to the king according to these words. Come now therefore, and let us take counsel together.
<DT><A NAME="6:8">6:8</A><DD>Then I sent unto him, saying, There are no such things done as thou sayest, but thou feignest them out of thine own heart.
<DT><A NAME="6:9">6:9</A><DD>For they all made us afraid, saying, Their hands shall be weakened from the work, that it be not done. Now therefore, <I>O God</I>, strengthen my hands.
<DT><A NAME="6:10">6:10</A><DD>Afterward I came unto the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah the son of Mehetabeel, who <I>was</I> shut up; and he said, Let us meet together in the house of God, within the temple, and let us shut the doors of the temple: for they will come to slay thee; yea, in the night will they come to slay thee.
<DT><A NAME="6:11">6:11</A><DD>And I said, Should such a man as I flee? and who <I>is there</I>, that, <I>being</I> as I <I>am</I>, would go into the temple to save his life? I will not go in.
<DT><A NAME="6:12">6:12</A><DD>And, lo, I perceived that God had not sent him; but that he pronounced this prophecy against me: for Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him.
<DT><A NAME="6:13">6:13</A><DD>Therefore <I>was</I> he hired, that I should be afraid, and do so, and sin, and <I>that</I> they might have <I>matter</I> for an evil report, that they might reproach me.
<DT><A NAME="6:14">6:14</A><DD>My God, think thou upon Tobiah and Sanballat according to these their works, and on the prophetess Noadiah, and the rest of the prophets, that would have put me in fear.
<DT><A NAME="6:15">6:15</A><DD>So the wall was finished in the twenty and fifth <I>day</I> of <I>the month</I> Elul, in fifty and two days.
<DT><A NAME="6:16">6:16</A><DD>And it came to pass, that when all our enemies heard <I>thereof</I>, and all the heathen that <I>were</I> about us saw <I>these things</I>, they were much cast down in their own eyes: for they perceived that this work was wrought of our God.
<DT><A NAME="6:17">6:17</A><DD>Moreover in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters unto Tobiah, and <I>the letters</I> of Tobiah came unto them.
<DT><A NAME="6:18">6:18</A><DD>For <I>there were</I> many in Judah sworn unto him, because he <I>was</I> the son in law of Shechaniah the son of Arah; and his son Johanan had taken the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah.
<DT><A NAME="6:19">6:19</A><DD>Also they reported his good deeds before me, and uttered my words to him. <I>And</I> Tobiah sent letters to put me in fear.

<DT><A NAME="13:2">13:2</A><DD>Because they met not the children of Israel with bread and with water, but hired Balaam against them, that he should curse them: howbeit our God turned the curse into a blessing.
<DT><A NAME="13:3">13:3</A><DD>Now it came to pass, when they had heard the law, that they separated from Israel all the mixed multitude.
<DT><A NAME="13:4">13:4</A><DD>And before this, Eliashib the priest, having the oversight of the chamber of the house of our God, <I>was</I> allied unto Tobiah:
<DT><A NAME="13:5">13:5</A><DD>And he had prepared for him a great chamber, where aforetime they laid the meat offerings, the frankincense, and the vessels, and the tithes of the corn, the new wine, and the oil, which was commanded <I>to be given</I> to the Levites, and the singers, and the porters; and the offerings of the priests.
<DT><A NAME="13:6">13:6</A><DD>But in all this <I>time</I> was not I at Jerusalem: for in the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon came I unto the king, and after certain days obtained I leave of the king:
<DT><A NAME="13:7">13:7</A><DD>And I came to Jerusalem, and understood of the evil that Eliashib did for Tobiah, in preparing him a chamber in the courts of the house of God.
<DT><A NAME="13:8">13:8</A><DD>And it grieved me sore: therefore I cast forth all the household stuff of Tobiah out of the chamber.
<DT><A NAME="13:9">13:9</A><DD>Then I commanded, and they cleansed the chambers: and thither brought I again the vessels of the house of God, with the meat offering and the frankincense.
<DT><A NAME="13:10">13:10</A><DD>And I perceived that the portions of the Levites had not been given <I>them</I>: for the Levites and the singers, that did the work, were fled every one to his field.
<DT><A NAME="13:11">13:11</A><DD>Then contended I with the rulers, and said, Why is the house of God forsaken? And I gathered them together, and set them in their place.
<DT><A NAME="13:12">13:12</A><DD>Then brought all Judah the tithe of the corn and the new wine and the oil unto the treasuries.
<DT><A NAME="13:13">13:13</A><DD>And I made treasurers over the treasuries, Shelemiah the priest, and Zadok the scribe, and of the Levites, Pedaiah: and next to them <I>was</I> Hanan the son of Zaccur, the son of Mattaniah: for they were counted faithful, and their office <I>was</I> to distribute unto their brethren.
<DT><A NAME="13:14">13:14</A><DD>Remember me, O my God, concerning this, and wipe not out my good deeds that I have done for the house of my God, and for the offices thereof.
<DT><A NAME="13:15">13:15</A><DD>In those days saw I in Judah <I>some</I> treading wine presses on the sabbath, and bringing in sheaves, and lading asses; as also wine, grapes, and figs, and all <I>manner of</I> burdens, which they brought into Jerusalem on the sabbath day: and I testified <I>against them</I> in the day wherein they sold victuals.
<DT><A NAME="13:16">13:16</A><DD>There dwelt men of Tyre also therein, which brought fish, and all manner of ware, and sold on the sabbath unto the children of Judah, and in Jerusalem.
<DT><A NAME="13:17">13:17</A><DD>Then I contended with the nobles of Judah, and said unto them, What evil thing <I>is</I> this that ye do, and profane the sabbath day?
<DT><A NAME="13:18">13:18</A><DD>Did not your fathers thus, and did not our God bring all this evil upon us, and upon this city? yet ye bring more wrath upon Israel by profaning the sabbath.
<DT><A NAME="13:19">13:19</A><DD>And it came to pass, that when the gates of Jerusalem began to be dark before the sabbath, I commanded that the gates should be shut, and charged that they should not be opened till after the sabbath: and <I>some</I> of my servants set I at the gates, <I>that</I> there should no burden be brought in on the sabbath day.
<DT><A NAME="13:20">13:20</A><DD>So the merchants and sellers of all kind of ware lodged without Jerusalem once or twice.
<DT><A NAME="13:21">13:21</A><DD>Then I testified against them, and said unto them, Why lodge ye about the wall? if ye do <I>so</I> again, I will lay hands on you. From that time forth came they no <I>more</I> on the sabbath.
<DT><A NAME="13:22">13:22</A><DD>And I commanded the Levites that they should cleanse themselves, and <I>that</I> they should come <I>and</I> keep the gates, to sanctify the sabbath day. Remember me, O my God, <I>concerning</I> this also, and spare me according to the greatness of thy mercy.
<DT><A NAME="13:23">13:23</A><DD>In those days also saw I Jews <I>that</I> had married wives of Ashdod, of Ammon, <I>and</I> of Moab:
<DT><A NAME="13:24">13:24</A><DD>And their children spake half in the speech of Ashdod, and could not speak in the Jews' language, but according to the language of each people.
<DT><A NAME="13:25">13:25</A><DD>And I contended with them, and cursed them, and smote certain of them, and plucked off their hair, and made them swear by God, <I>saying</I>, Ye shall not give your daughters unto their sons, nor take their daughters unto your sons, or for yourselves.
<DT><A NAME="13:26">13:26</A><DD>Did not Solomon king of Israel sin by these things? yet among many nations was there no king like him, who was beloved of his God, and God made him king over all Israel: nevertheless even him did outlandish women cause to sin.
<DT><A NAME="13:27">13:27</A><DD>Shall we then hearken unto you to do all this great evil, to transgress against our God in marrying strange wives?
<DT><A NAME="13:28">13:28</A><DD>And <I>one</I> of the sons of Joiada, the son of Eliashib the high priest, <I>was</I> son in law to Sanballat the Horonite: therefore I chased him from me.
<DT><A NAME="13:29">13:29</A><DD>Remember them, O my God, because they have defiled the priesthood, and the covenant of the priesthood, and of the Levites.
<DT><A NAME="13:30">13:30</A><DD>Thus cleansed I them from all strangers, and appointed the wards of the priests and the Levites, every one in his business;
<DT><A NAME="13:31">13:31</A><DD>And for the wood offering, at times appointed, and for the firstfruits. Remember me, O my God, for good.
