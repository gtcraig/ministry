</TABLE>
<DIV CLASS=a><DL>
<DT><A NAME="1:1">1:1f called</A><DD>'A called apostle,' i.e. an apostle by (divine) calling. Cf. <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/ro?n=1:7">ver. 7</A> 'called saints,' and see <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ro?n=1:7">note</A> there.
<DT><A NAME="1:2">1:2g writings</A><DD>'In holy writings:' there is no article in the original. The statement of the apostle is general, addressing himself, as he does, to Gentiles.
<DT><A NAME="1:4">1:4h Spirit</A><DD>In many cases it is impossible to put a small or a large S rightly to the word Spirit, as the presence and power of the Holy Spirit characterizes the state, and that and the state are both included; so it is here. It is divine, not merely human, perfectness, and by the Holy Spirit, yet it is Christ's state. But it is not merely a state, but that state which consists in the presence and power of the Holy Spirit, and is the absolute expression of it. On the whole, I put a large S here, but it is the Son manifested on earth who is spoken of, and characteristic of him. Resurrection was the proof, but he who had eyes to see, saw what came in flesh justified in the Spirit even when here, the same Spirit which was quickening power in resurrection, as <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/1pe?n=3:18">1Pet. 3:18</A>.
<DT><A NAME="1:4a">1:4i holiness</A><DD><I>Hagiosune</I>, the nature and quality itself, as <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/2co?n=7:1">2Cor. 7:1</A> and <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/1th?n=3:13">1Thess. 3:13</A>. Distinct from <I>hagiasmos</I>, the practical effect produced, the character in activity, translated 'holiness' in <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/ro?n=6:19">Rom. 6:19</A>, <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/ro?n=6:22">22</A>; <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/1co?n=1:30">1Cor. 1:30</A>; <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/1ti?n=2:15">1Tim. 2:15</A>; <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/heb?n=12:14">Heb. 12:14</A>; and 'sanctification' in <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/1th?n=4:3">1Thess. 4:3</A>; <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/1th?n=4:7">4:7</A>; <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/2th?n=2:13">2Thess. 2:13</A> and <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/1pe?n=1:2">1Pet. 1:2</A>. Another word, <I>hagiotes</I>, is used in <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/heb?n=12:10">Heb. 12:10</A> (the only time in Scripture), for the quality itself.
<DT><A NAME="1:4b">1:4k dead</A><DD>Plural, 'of dead persons.'
<DT><A NAME="1:6">1:6a called</A><DD>'Called ones of Jesus Christ' is what they are.
<DT><A NAME="1:7">1:7b called</A><DD>'Called saints' is ambiguous in English, but the sense is that they are saints by the calling of God. The Greek implies that they are already saints, not called to be so.
<DT><A NAME="1:10">1:10c prospered</A><DD>This does not refer to a prosperous journey, but to the hope that God may favour or prosper him so that he may come; he had long wished it, and hoped that at last it might be granted him.
<DT><A NAME="1:17">1:17d God</A><DD>'Righteousness of God.' The absence of the article may arrest the mind here, and in some other places, in this part of the epistle. It is likely to do so, because <I>the</I> righteousness of God is now a known doctrine; not so when the apostle taught. The righteousness of God was a wholly new thought, as was indeed wrath from heaven: wrath on earth was not. The gospel, or 'glad tidings,' was the power of God to salvation, because righteousness of God (that kind of righteousness) was revealed -- not a righteousness required of man. See <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/ro?n=3:21">ch. 3:21</A>.
<DT><A NAME="1:17a">1:17e by</A><DD>'By faith.' The word 'by' is the same in Greek (<I>ek</I>) as that translated 'on the principle of.' I have left 'by' as being a quotation from <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/hab?n=2:4">Hab. 2:4</A>.
<DT><A NAME="1:18">1:18f heaven</A><DD>'Wrath of God from heaven is revealed:' see <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ro?n=1:17">Note d</A>; 'there' is merely the impersonal form, not an adverb, but necessary, as it is difficult to put the words in another order without injuring the sense.
<DT><A NAME="1:19">1:19g is</A><DD>Or 'may be.' The Greek word here is used for 'may be known.' What is spoken of here is 'knowledge acquirable by nature in contrast with revelation,' it means what is within the capacity of man's apprehension. But 'is known' sufficiently represents that and is more exact.
<DT><A NAME="1:20">1:20h divinity</A><DD>What is characteristic of God; <I>not</I> 'Godhead,' as in <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/col?n=2:9">Col. 2:9</A>.
<DT><A NAME="1:20a">1:20i render</A><DD>The Greek expression does not affirm that they are so, but states the consequence of the display of creative glory in what was seen. 'So that they should,' or 'might be,' is ambiguous in English, and implies purpose. Hence I have said 'so as to render,' which gives the sense.
<DT><A NAME="1:21">1:21a Because</A><DD>This is the second reason: the first is <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/ro?n=1:19">ver. 19</A>.
<DT><A NAME="1:21a">1:21b thoughts</A><DD>The 'inward reasonings of the mind,' as <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/lu?n=9:46">Luke 9:46</A>. The word 'thoughts' in English conveys this best.
<DT><A NAME="1:25">1:25c who</A><DD>The word implies the character: 'who were such as,' see <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/mt?n=7:24">Matt. 7:24</A>.
<DT><A NAME="1:28">1:28d good</A><DD>Not 'did not like.' The word means 'to assay, test, prove,' and thence 'to approve' as <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/php?n=1:10">Phil. 1:10</A>.
<DT><A NAME="1:28a">1:28e reprobate</A><DD>Or, as some, 'a mind void of moral discernment.'
<DT><A NAME="1:30">1:30f God</A><DD>I doubt that it has the sense of 'God-haters.' It acquired the sense of 'abominably wicked:' as 'cursed children' does not mean that a curse is pronounced, but that they are fit only to be so named. It is the moral state.
<DT><A NAME="1:32">1:32g who</A><DD>As in <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/ro?n=1:25">v. 25</A>, 'who being such as so knew.'
<DT><A NAME="1:32a">1:32h judgment</A><DD><I>Dikaioma</I>: what the righteous will of God requires; hence even an ordinance of his will, or a righteous act meeting his requirement. See <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/ro?n=5:18">ch. 5:18</A>; <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/lu?n=1:6">Luke 1:6</A>; and <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/re?n=15:4">Rev. 15:4</A>, where it is judgment itself. In <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/ro?n=2:5">ch. 2:5</A>, 'righteous judgment' is <I>dikaiokrisia</I>.
<DT><A NAME="1:32b">1:32i do</A><DD><I>Prasso</I>: to do an act: see <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/joh?n=5:29">John 5:29</A>.
<DT><A NAME="1:32c">1:32k practise</A><DD><I>Poieo</I>: practise a course of action: see <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/joh?n=5:29">John 5:29</A>.
<DT><A NAME="1:32d">1:32l delight</A><DD>It means that not only their own passions carry them away, but, being thoroughly corrupt, they enjoy other people's sinning, associating themselves in thought and spirit with them, as taking pleasure in their doing so.
<DT><A NAME="2:1">2:1m condemnest</A><DD>A play on words in Greek, strengthening the sense. The words for 'judgment' and 'condemnest' are from the same root.
<DT><A NAME="2:7">2:7a works</A><DD>Lit. 'good work,' singular.
<DT><A NAME="2:7a">2:7b incorruptibility</A><DD>Not 'immortality;' the resurrection, or change, of the body is looked for; and it is thus a part of Christian truth: see <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/2ti?n=1:10">2Tim. 1:10</A>.
<DT><A NAME="2:15">2:15c who</A><DD>As <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/ro?n=1:32">ch. 1:32</A>.
<DT><A NAME="2:15a">2:15d written</A><DD>It is not the law, but the work which is written.
<DT><A NAME="2:22">2:22e sacrilege</A><DD>See <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/ac?n=19:37">Acts 19:37</A>.
<DT><A NAME="2:24">2:24f written</A><DD>See <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/isa?n=52:5">Isa. 52:5</A>; <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/eze?n=36:20~a=3">Ezek. 36:20-23</A>.
<DT><A NAME="2:26">2:26g requirements</A><DD><I>Dikaioma</I>, as 'righteous judgment,' <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/ro?n=1:32">ch. 1:32</A>.
<DT><A NAME="2:26a">2:26h reckoned</A><DD>Often translated 'imputed' in A.V.
<DT><A NAME="2:27">2:27i with</A><DD><I>Dia</I>. The expression has the sense of 'in a given state or condition,' as well as 'by means of.' Their having or possessing the letter of the law and circumcision practically puts the Jews in that condition.
<DT><A NAME="2:28">2:28k outwardly</A><DD>'Openly,' 'manifestedly.'
<DT><A NAME="2:29">2:29l inwardly</A><DD>'In what is hidden or secret.'
<DT><A NAME="3:3">3:3a faith</A><DD>Or 'faithfulness.'
<DT><A NAME="3:4">3:4b written</A><DD>See <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/ps?n=51:4">Ps. 51:4</A>.
<DT><A NAME="3:5">3:5c wrath</A><DD>'Inflicts wrath' is hardly English, as wrath is a sentiment of the mind; and it is what reaches another which is inflicted, as punishment or pain. But 'executes' is not the sense, nor is 'takes vengeance.' The form of expression in Greek, as in the use of 'inflict' in English, is a figure of the effect for the cause, so I have ventured to use it.
<DT><A NAME="3:7">3:7d abounded</A><DD>Or 'has more abounded by my lie.' In the translation in the text the thought is 'he remained true in spite of my failure.'
<DT><A NAME="3:12">3:12e one</A><DD><A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/ps?n=14:1~a=2">Ps. 14:1-3</A>.
<DT><A NAME="3:13">3:13f deceit</A><DD><A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/ps?n=5:9">Ps. 5:9</A>.
<DT><A NAME="3:13a">3:13g lips</A><DD><A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/ps?n=140:3">Ps. 140:3</A>.
<DT><A NAME="3:14">3:14h bitterness</A><DD><A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/ps?n=10:7">Ps. 10:7</A>.
<DT><A NAME="3:17">3:17i known</A><DD><A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/isa?n=59:7~a=1">Isa. 59:7-8</A>.
<DT><A NAME="3:18">3:18k eyes</A><DD><A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/ps?n=36:1">Ps. 36:1</A>.
<DT><A NAME="3:19">3:19l under</A><DD>Lit. 'in' <I>en</I>.
<DT><A NAME="3:19a">3:19m be</A><DD>i.e. 'become in that state,' not future, but the existing consequence.
<DT><A NAME="3:21">3:21n without</A><DD>'Apart from:' see <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/heb?n=9:28">Heb. 9:28</A>.
<DT><A NAME="3:21a">3:21o God</A><DD>See <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ro?n=1:17">Note, ch. 1:17</A>.
<DT><A NAME="3:23">3:23p short</A><DD>The present fact, 'they come short;' 'come' is not dependent on 'have.'
<DT><A NAME="3:25">3:25q mercy-seat</A><DD>I do not think this word can be used for '<I>a</I> propitiatory <I>sacrifice</I>' or 'propitiation;' it certainly is not the habitual use in the LXX; and we have the two parts of the work of the great day of atonement, here and in <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/ro?n=4:25">ch. 4:25</A>; 'set forth,' here, has a reflexive force; see <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_heb?n=1:3c">Note e, Heb. 1:3</A>.
<DT><A NAME="3:25a">3:25a by</A><DD>'In respect of the passing by the sins.' I have hesitated as to using <I>dia</I> with the accusative in this sense here; but on the whole I do not doubt it gives the sense. God had passed by, not brought into judgment, the sins of Old Testament believers; and the accomplishment of the atonement showed His righteousness in this. <I>Now</I> the righteousness is itself shown, and to be relied on.
<DT><A NAME="4:3">4:3b say</A><DD>See <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/ge?n=15:6">Gen. 15:6</A>.
<DT><A NAME="4:3a">4:3c as</A><DD>I am not quite satisfied with 'as;' but it is the nearest approach to the sense in English. 'For,' I object to; because then faith is made of positive worth, having the value of righteousness; whereas the sense is that he was holden for righteous in virtue of faith. 'For' does not go far enough as righteousness; too far as to a positive value of faith. Faith might be reckoned for righteousness, and yet the righteousness come short of what was required; whereas if it be reckoned as righteousness, then the full value of righteousness, as such, is seen: 'the man was held to have righteousness.' It is a Hebrew form. See <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/ps?n=106:31">Ps. 106:31</A>. <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/ge?n=15:6">Gen. 15:6</A>, where there is no preposition, makes the force of the expression plain.
<DT><A NAME="4:5">4:5d on</A><DD>See <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ac?n=9:42">Note, Acts 9:42</A>.
<DT><A NAME="4:6">4:6e without</A><DD>As <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/ro?n=3:21">ch. 3:21</A>.
<DT><A NAME="4:6a">4:6f works</A><DD>See <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/ps?n=32:1~a=1">Ps. 32:1-2</A>.
<DT><A NAME="4:8">4:8g sin</A><DD>That is, 'not account of him as having any.'
<DT><A NAME="4:11">4:11h be</A><DD>'In order to his being.' It is necessary perhaps to say, 'that he might be' in English; but that is an expression of purpose which goes rather too far. See <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ro?n=1:20a">Note i, ch. 1:20</A>.
<DT><A NAME="4:12">4:12a Abraham</A><DD>'Father of circumcision' means, he in whom real separation to God was first publicly established. Perhaps 'of the faith, during <I>his</I> uncircumcision, of our father Abraham' may be clearer.
<DT><A NAME="4:15">4:15b law</A><DD>Or 'For the law.'
<DT><A NAME="4:17">4:17c written</A><DD>See <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/ge?n=17:5">Gen. 17:5</A>
<DT><A NAME="4:18">4:18d in</A><DD>Or 'with,' <I>epi</I>. It is the state or condition of his mind in believing: see <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/ro?n=10:19">ch. 10:19</A> and <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/1co?n=9:10">1Cor. 9:10</A>, and <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2ti?n=1:12">Note at 2Tim. 1:12</A>.
<DT><A NAME="4:18a">4:18e spoken</A><DD><A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/ge?n=15:5">Gen. 15:5</A>.
<DT><A NAME="4:20">4:20f faith</A><DD>'Found strength in faith' may be rather free, but 'strengthened by faith' might very easily be applied to his body, whereas it means that he was inwardly strengthened by faith. It is, I apprehend, in opposition to 'hesitating through unbelief.' Literally, it is 'gifted with strength.' Abraham was gifted with strength by faith (i.e. inwardly, in contrast with doubt).
<DT><A NAME="4:24">4:24g on</A><DD>See <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ac?n=9:42">Note, Acts 9:42</A>.
<DT><A NAME="4:25">4:25h justification</A><DD>See <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ro?n=5:16b">Note k, ch. 5:16</A>.
<DT><A NAME="5:2">5:2i have</A><DD>Perfect tense: 'have obtained and possess.'
<DT><A NAME="5:6">5:6k died</A><DD>Or 'died:' so <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/ro?n=5:8">ver. 8</A>. The aorist; but 'has died' is used in English for the fact, which is the force of the aorist. That is, it is so used where the moral import is an abiding one, and time is not in question, even if no abiding effect is meant. 'He has taken a journey.' The simple preterite, 'died,' is not an aorist in English; it is historical, and the fact is viewed as past and done with.
<DT><A NAME="5:9">5:9a, 5:10a of</A><DD>Or 'by his blood,' 'by his life:' when <I>en</I> is used morally it has the force of 'in the power of,' 'in the intrinsic character of;' thus 'in flesh,' 'in spirit.' The article and pronoun here give it a somewhat more instrumental character. 'Through' in <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/ro?n=5:10">ver. 10</A> is <I>dia</I>.
<DT><A NAME="5:12">5:12b *</A><DD>The epistle divides itself here, as to doctrine, into two distinct parts, which a new paragraph hardly shows. Up to <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/ro?n=5:11">ch. 5:11</A> 'sins' had been treated of; from this point 'sin' is in view.
<DT><A NAME="5:13">5:13c account</A><DD>This is a different word from that translated 'reckoned' in <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/ro?n=4:22~a=1">ch. 4:22, 23</A> (both 'imputed' in A.V.). There, a man is judicially estimated such or such: here, a particular fault is put to a person's account. The former is found in <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/ga?n=3:6">Gal. 3:6</A> and <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/2co?n=5:19">2Cor. 5:19</A>; this only in <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/phm?n=1:18">Philem. 18</A>.
<DT><A NAME="5:14">5:14d reigned</A><DD>Or 'has reigned,' aorist.
<DT><A NAME="5:14a">5:14e in</A><DD>Or 'according to.' 'Sinned after' is not the sense here. It refers to <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/ho?n=6:7">Hos. 6:7</A>, 'They, like Adam, have transgressed the covenant:' this of Israel. But they who had no law did not. The point here is the form or character in or with which anything happens; that which gives it its character.
<DT><A NAME="5:15">5:15f offence</A><DD>Or 'not as the offence <I>is</I> the act of favour.'
<DT><A NAME="5:15a">5:15g one</A><DD>Lit. 'the one.'
<DT><A NAME="5:16">5:16h gift</A><DD>Or 'And not as by one that sinned <I>is</I> the gift.' I would add that I have translated the Greek words, <I>dorema</I> as 'gift,' <I>charisma</I> as 'act of favour,' and <I>dorea</I> as 'free gift.' This will distinguish them.
<DT><A NAME="5:16a">5:16i of</A><DD>That is, had its foundation in, was grounded on, one single thing or act.
<DT><A NAME="5:16b">5:16k justification</A><DD><I>Dikaioma</I>; or 'judicial righteousness.' Here the Greek is more exact than English perhaps allows. It is the state of accomplished subsisting righteousness before God, in which justification places us.

In English we must use justification for both. I cannot say 'righteousness;' that might be practical. In <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/ro?n=4:25">ch. 4:25</A> the doing of it was in view, 'for our justifying;' not, as some read, 'because we are justified,' which could only be said in connection with faith, whereas 'for our justifying' is the effect future to the rising again.

<DT><A NAME="9:3">9:3b brethren</A><DD>I apprehend, in the apostle's mind the phrase 'for my brethren' is connected with both 'pain in my heart' and 'a curse from Christ;' he parenthetically states how far his heart had gone for Israel, and then continues the phrase. This want of strict continuation of grammatical structure is very common with the apostle from the ardour of his style, and only adds force to what he says. He had loved them as much as Moses. (<A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/ex?n=32:32">Ex. 32:32</A>.) His pain was continuous: but the wish, 'to be a curse,' was like that of Moses, a moment's earnest appeal, as beside himself.

<DT><A NAME="10:1">10:1i delight</A><DD>i.e. his good pleasure, the thought that delighted him. The order of the words gives the force of 'own,' or an emphatic '<I>my</I>.'

<DT><A NAME="10:1a">10:1k them</A><DD>Some authorities have 'for Israel,' but 'for them' is the more correct reading, and, occupied as the apostle is with his subject, is far more beautiful. 'For salvation' is perhaps a little obscure; but what he says is, what would satisfy his heart was that; and his prayers tended that way, not to their judgment, evil as they were, and rejecters of Christ.
