<DIV CLASS=a><DL>
<DT><A NAME="1:1">1:1g formerly</A><DD>Or 'of old.'
<DT><A NAME="1:2">1:2h end</A><DD>See <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/isa?n=2:2">Isa. 2:2</A>. A Hebrew expression, as several here, for the end of the period of law, when Messiah was to be introduced.
<DT><A NAME="1:2a">1:2i the</A><DD>Lit. 'in Son.' The absence of the Greek article here is important, though difficult to render in English; the result is, that God, speaking in <I>the</I> prophets, and using them as his mouth, is clearly distinct: 'in Son' is not exactly 'as Son,' because that would be the character of the speaking, yet is perhaps the nearest to an adequate expression. It is God himself who speaks; not by another; not as the Father nor in the person of the Father; not merely by the Holy Spirit using a person not divine, but as himself a divine person, and that person the Son.
<DT><A NAME="1:2b">1:2a worlds</A><DD>A Jewish expression, meaning 'the universe.'
<DT><A NAME="1:3">1:3b effulgence</A><DD>That which fully presents the glory which is in something else. Thus light makes us know what the sun is; the tabernacle, what the pattern in the mount was.
<DT><A NAME="1:3a">1:3c substance</A><DD>Clearly 'substance,' 'essential being,' not 'person.' It is of God, not of the Father.
<DT><A NAME="1:3b">1:3d his</A><DD>That is, his own, the Son's.
<DT><A NAME="1:3c">1:3e made</A><DD>The form (middle) of the verb here, has a peculiar reflexive force, 'having done it for himself.' Though we, as alone the sinners, have the profit, yet the work was done within his own person and work, without us, as when a man journeys, and so when he makes a person his friend, his wife.
<DT><A NAME="1:5">1:5f thee</A><DD>See <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/ps?n=2:7">Ps. 2:7</A>.
<DT><A NAME="1:5a">1:5g son</A><DD>See <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/1ch?n=17:13">1Chron. 17:13</A>.
<DT><A NAME="1:6">1:6h brings</A><DD>The present tense in English gives the sense of the aorist here. The reference is to <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/ps?n=97">Ps. 97</A>, where he is just coming in, in his kingdom glory; but, in a certain sense, he must be there to be worshipped. His introduction is antecedent to his worship as firstborn, but it is on introducing him that this follows (hence the aorist), not when his whole introducing is a past thing. The glory of the person of Christ is before the writer, not the time of introducing. I have no doubt that the translation I give is the only right one.
<DT><A NAME="1:6a">1:6i him</A><DD>See <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/ps?n=97:7">Ps. 97:7</A>: 'worship' is <I>proskuneo</I>.
<DT><A NAME="1:7">1:7k ministers</A><DD><I>Leitourgos</I>. See <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ro?n=15:16a">Note k, to Rom. 15:16</A>. 'Ministering' in <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/heb?n=1:14">ver. 14</A> is from the same root.
<DT><A NAME="1:7a">1:7l fire</A><DD>See <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/ps?n=104:4">Ps. 104:4</A>.
<DT><A NAME="1:9">1:9m companions</A><DD><I>Metochos</I>: see <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_heb?n=2:14b">Note q, ch. 2:14</A>: and <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/ps?n=45:6~a=1">Ps. 45:6, 7</A>.
<DT><A NAME="1:12">1:12n Same</A><DD>'The existing one who does not change.' Every creature is changeable. A divine title: see <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/de?n=32:39">Deut. 32:39</A>.
<DT><A NAME="1:12a">1:12o fail</A><DD>See <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/ps?n=102:25">Ps. 102:25</A>, <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/ps?n=102:27">27</A>.
<DT><A NAME="1:13">1:13p feet</A><DD>See <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/ps?n=110:1">Ps. 110:1</A>.
<DT><A NAME="2:2">2:2q was</A><DD>That is, was so when given; all is in the aorist here, or a truth as to the past.
<DT><A NAME="2:3">2:3r of</A><DD>Not merely neglected when presented, but not cared for when, as here, they were nominally inside making profession. As <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/mt?n=22:5">Matt. 22:5</A>: 'They made light of' the invitation to the supper. <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/1ti?n=4:14">1Tim. 4:14</A>: 'negligent' of the gift in him: he had it. <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/heb?n=8:9">Heb. 8:9</A>: Israel was disobedient, and Jehovah 'did not regard them.'
<DT><A NAME="2:5">2:5a come</A><DD>A known division among the Jews. First, 'this age;' and then what was to be introduced by the Messiah: see <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/heb?n=6:5">ch. 6:5</A> and <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_heb?n=9:9a">Note h, ch. 9:9</A>; <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/tit?n=2:12">Tit. 2:12</A>.
<DT><A NAME="2:6">2:6b saying</A><DD>See <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/ps?n=8:4~a=2">Ps. 8:4-6</A>.
<DT><A NAME="2:6a">2:6c rememberest</A><DD>An active recollection, because the object is cared for: so <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/heb?n=13:3">ch. 13:3</A>.
<DT><A NAME="2:9">2:9d angels</A><DD>Or 'him who was made ... angels, <I>even</I> Jesus:' see <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/ps?n=8:5">Ps. 8:5</A>.
<DT><A NAME="2:9a">2:9e that</A><DD>The 'so that' is an appended sentence: 'he was made lower ... so that.' <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/heb?n=2:10">Ver. 10</A> justifies his being made lower for suffering death. The crowning is the accomplishment of the Psalm.
<DT><A NAME="2:9b">2:9f thing</A><DD>Or 'every one.'
<DT><A NAME="2:10">2:10g perfect</A><DD>'Make perfect' in Hebrews has the force of doing all required to initiate into an office, to make a person fit to be installed in the office. It is sometimes translated 'consecrate.'
<DT><A NAME="2:10a">2:10h leader</A><DD>See <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ac?n=3:15">Note, Acts 3:15</A>.
<DT><A NAME="2:11">2:11i sanctified</A><DD>Simply the character of the persons, without reference to done or doing.
<DT><A NAME="2:12">2:12k saying</A><DD>See <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/ps?n=22:22">Ps. 22:22</A>.
<DT><A NAME="2:12a">2:12l praises</A><DD>Or 'praise <I>thee</I> with singing.' Lit. 'hymn thee:' see <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/mt?n=26:30">Matt. 26:30</A>.
<DT><A NAME="2:13">2:13m him</A><DD>See <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/isa?n=8:17">Isa. 8:17</A> LXX, 'I will look for him.'
<DT><A NAME="2:13a">2:13n me</A><DD>See <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/isa?n=8:18">Isa. 8:18</A>.
<DT><A NAME="2:14">2:14o partake</A><DD><I>Koinoneo</I>: that is, they are in that condition, as their common lot.
<DT><A NAME="2:14a">2:14p manner</A><DD>'In like manner' is strictly 'near to,' as <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/php?n=2:27">Phil. 2:27</A>, 'close to.'
<DT><A NAME="2:14b">2:14q in</A><DD>There is an intended difference here between the words for 'partake' (<I>koinoneo</I>) and 'took part in' (<I>metecho</I>), <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/heb?n=2:14">ver. 14</A>. The first, referring to the children, is a common equal sharing of the nature. The second, referring to Christ, means, he took a part in it; and refers always to something outside myself, but which I take, or take a part in. The first work refers to a joint participation in that which belongs to me or to known fellowship. The second is used in <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/heb?n=5:13">ch. 5:13</A>, 'partakes of milk,' in <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/1co?n=9:10">1Cor. 9:10</A>, where the reaper gets a share in the sower's hope, and in <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/1co?n=10:17">1Cor. 10:17</A>, <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/1co?n=10:21">21</A>, <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/1co?n=10:30">30</A>, 'partake,' where 'partaking' (<I>metecho</I>) is proof of participation in fellowship (<I>koinonia</I>), <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/heb?n=2:16">ver. 16</A>. The word does not say how far the taking share went.
<DT><A NAME="2:14c">2:14r has</A><DD>Or 'who had;' lit. 'having,' without reference to time. Cf. <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/heb?n=13:20">ch. 13:20</A>.
<DT><A NAME="2:16">2:16a hand</A><DD>It means 'to take hold of,' but it is constantly used for 'taking up a person to help him,' though in other senses as well. We say, 'he took him by the hand,' but this may be too familiar. It is used in the sense of 'taking hold of,' literally 'deliver.' The same word is used in this verse as to 'the seed of Abraham,' and also in the quotation from <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/jer?n=31:31~a=4">Jer. 31</A> in <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/heb?n=8:9">ch. 8:9</A>, but there 'hand' is added in the Greek.
<DT><A NAME="2:17">2:17b him</A><DD>He speaks, I apprehend, historically; it was necessary for him to do this by the alleged reason, not his present judgment of divine necessity or purpose. 'Has behoved' would speak more of continuance. It behoved him when he became a man. It is what he became as man, not what he took on him.
<DT><A NAME="3:1">3:1c partakers</A><DD>Here <I>metochos</I>, who have been made, called to be, partakers of it. They had been <I>koinonoi</I> of Israel's rights. See <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/heb?n=2:14">ch. 2:14</A>.
<DT><A NAME="3:2">3:2d house</A><DD>See <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/nu?n=12:7">Num. 12:7</A>.
<DT><A NAME="3:5">3:5e, 3:6e his</A><DD>That is, God's house, in which Moses was faithful as a ministering servant. The contrast is with 'Moses as a servant in,' and 'Christ as a Son over.' The Father is not brought in as such at all, but the Son is over the house as Son. The connection with its being God's house is evident, because he (Christ) has built the house, <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/heb?n=3:3">ver. 3</A>, and he who built all things is God; but he is over it as Son.
<DT><A NAME="3:7">3:7f Spirit</A><DD>See <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/ps?n=95:7~a=4">Ps. 95:7-11</A>.
<DT><A NAME="3:9">3:9g where</A><DD>Some translate 'wherewith,' that is, 'with which temptation.'
<DT><A NAME="3:11">3:11h rest</A><DD>A Hebraism involving a strong negative. Compare <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/nu?n=14:23">Num. 14:23</A>; <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/mr?n=8:12">Mark 8:12</A>.
<DT><A NAME="3:14">3:14i companions</A><DD><I>Metochos</I>, as <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/heb?n=1:9">ch. 1:9</A> (quoting <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/ps?n=45:7">Ps. 45:7</A>), to which it alludes. It is not 'partakers of Christ.'
<DT><A NAME="3:15">3:15k provocation</A><DD>I have no doubt, in spite of objections, that 16-19 is a parenthesis.
<DT><A NAME="3:16">3:16l not</A><DD>Or 'was it not indeed.'
<DT><A NAME="3:17">3:17a carcases</A><DD>Lit. 'limbs:' often used for a carcase. Some suppose the idea of the body falling to pieces.
<DT><A NAME="3:18">3:18b, 4:6b word</A><DD><I>Apeitheo</I>: see <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_joh?n=3:36a">Note e, John 3:36</A>. 'Who had not hearkened to the word' is, I apprehend, the true force here. It is taken from the LXX, <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/nu?n=14:43">Num. 14:43</A> and <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/de?n=1:26">Deut. 1:26</A>, which refer to the occasion on which God declared their carcases should fall in the wilderness.
<DT><A NAME="4:4">4:4c works</A><DD>See <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/ge?n=2:2">Gen. 2:2</A>.
<DT><A NAME="4:8">4:8d Jesus</A><DD>Greek for Joshua: see <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_nu?n=13:16a">Note, Num. 13:16</A>.
<DT><A NAME="4:11">4:11e diligence, enter</A><DD>Aorists: i.e. 'be in a state of having done it.'
<DT><A NAME="4:11a">4:11f word</A><DD>See <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_heb?n=3:18">Note, ch. 3:18</A>.
<DT><A NAME="4:12">4:12g division</A><DD>The passage has, I judge, the sense of dividing between each pair of objects and not of dividing each of the things by itself.
<DT><A NAME="4:15">4:15h manner</A><DD>Or 'according to <I>our</I> likeness,' which has substantially the same sense, 'according to the likeness of the way in which we are tempted.'
<DT><A NAME="5:5">5:5a thee</A><DD>See <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/ps?n=2:7">Ps. 2:7</A>.
<DT><A NAME="5:6">5:6b ever</A><DD><I>Eis ton aiona</I>: 'into the age.' Not <I>eis to dienekes</I>, as in <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/heb?n=7:3">chs. 7:3</A>; <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/heb?n=10:1">10:1</A>, <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/heb?n=10:12">12</A>, <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/heb?n=10:14">14</A>; this last is continuing uninterruptedness more than there being no end, though it may so continue.
<DT><A NAME="5:6a">5:6c Melchisedec</A><DD>See <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/ps?n=110:4">Ps. 110:4</A>.
<DT><A NAME="5:7">5:7d of</A><DD><I>Ek</I>, 'out of,' not 'from.'
<DT><A NAME="5:7a">5:7e piety</A><DD>Or 'fear,' as some translate; and then well rendered, as in A.V., 'in that he feared.'
<DT><A NAME="5:8">5:8f Son</A><DD>Alluding to the citation of <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/ps?n=2:7">Ps. 2</A> just above.
<DT><A NAME="5:9">5:9g author</A><DD>Lit. 'a causer,' 'one who caused.'
<DT><A NAME="5:10">5:10h by</A><DD>Or 'saluted of'
<DT><A NAME="5:13">5:13i, 6:4i partakes</A><DD>'Partakes,' <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/heb?n=5:13">ch. 5:13</A> is <I>metecho</I>. 'Partakers,' <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/heb?n=6:4">ch. 6:4</A>, is <I>metochos</I>, see <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_heb?n=2:14b">Note q, ch. 2:14</A>.
<DT><A NAME="6:1">6:1k word</A><DD><I>Logos</I>, which includes the thoughts as well as the utterance of them: 'doctrine,' <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/heb?n=6:2">ver. 2</A>, is a different word: see <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1co?n=1:5">Note, 1Cor. 1:5</A>.
<DT><A NAME="6:1a">6:1l growth</A><DD>The Greek word is used for 'perfection' or 'full growth.' So in <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/heb?n=5:14">ch. 5:14</A> 'solid food belongs to full-grown men' to which allusion is made here.
<DT><A NAME="6:1b">6:1m in</A><DD><I>Epi</I>, lit. 'on God,' as <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/ac?n=9:42">Acts 9:42</A>; <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/ac?n=11:17">11:17</A>; <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/ac?n=16:31">16:31</A>; <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/ac?n=22:19">22:19</A>; <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/ro?n=4:5">Rom. 4:5</A>, <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/ro?n=4:24">24</A> -- the actual personal object of faith trusted in as such: see <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2ti?n=1:12">Note, 2Tim. 1:12</A>.

<DT><A NAME="6:11">6:11a earnestly</A><DD>A longing for anything, as <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/lu?n=22:15">Luke 22:15</A>, and in contrast, see <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/lu?n=15:16">Luke 15:16</A>.

<DT><A NAME="6:12a">6:12c inheritors</A><DD>This refers to the past, but speaks only of the character of the person; but as an actuality.
<DT><A NAME="6:14">6:14d thee</A><DD>See <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/ge?n=22:17">Gen. 22:17</A>.
<DT><A NAME="6:17">6:17e Wherin</A><DD>Many translate 'wherefore,' 'on which account.'

<DT><A NAME="7:5">7:5k priesthood</A><DD>Only here and <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/lu?n=1:9">Luke 1:9</A>. It is the personal office that a man receives. 'Priesthood' in <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/heb?n=7:11~a=1">vers. 11, 12</A>, <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/heb?n=7:24">24</A>, is the system itself.

For 'the branch' was translated 'dayspring' by the LXX, and the verb is used for both in Greek: see <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/jer?n=23:5">Jer. 23:5</A>; <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/zec?n=3:8">Zech. 3:8</A>.

<DT><A NAME="7:26">7:26i holy</A><DD>There are two Greek words used for 'holy' in the New Testament -- <I>hagios</I> and <I>hosios</I> (<I>hosios</I> is used in this passage). The word most commonly used is <I>hagios</I> (corresponding to the Hebrew word <I>kadosh</I>). This, when applied to God, designates him as holy, knowing good and evil perfectly, and absolutely willing good and no evil. When applied to men, it designates them as separated, set apart to God from evil and from common use. The corresponding verb is commonly translated 'to sanctify;' and the word when used as a substantive is the ordinary word for 'saints.' The word <I>hosios</I>, on the other hand, conveys the thought of pious, that which is not profane. It speaks of God in mercy and grace, and of Christ, in whom all gracious qualities are concentrated, as well as perfect piety. It corresponds to the Hebrew <I>chesed</I>, of which the plural (<I>chasadim</I>) is the word translated 'mercies' or 'sure mercies' in the Old Testament. When applied to men, it is in general the sum of qualities which suit and form the divine character in man, as opposed to the human will. It refers to the exercise of gracious suitable affections in the relationships in which we are to God, and (e.g.) to parents. Hence, as suitable affections to God practically constitute holiness, the word is used in this sense for holy. The two Hebrew words are used side by side in <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/ps?n=89:18~a=1">Ps. 89:18, 19</A>, 'The Holy One (<I>kadosh</I>) of Israel is our king. ... Then thou spakest in vision to thy Holy One (<I>Chasid</I>).' The beginning of the Psalm speaks of the mercies or gracious ways (<I>chasadim</I>) of the Lord. (See, for <I>hosios</I>, <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/ac?n=2:27">Acts 2:27</A>; <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/ac?n=13:34~a=1">13:34, 35</A>; <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/1ti?n=2:8">1Tim. 2:8</A>; <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/tit?n=1:8">Tit. 1:8</A>; <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/re?n=15:4">Rev. 15:4</A>; <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/re?n=16:5">16:5</A>.)

<DT><A NAME="9:1a">9:1d one</A><DD>The form of words here is greatly disputed. The grammatical order would require it to be translated 'the holy universal order;' but the word, it is contended, does not exist with this sense: I have not ventured so to translate it. I doubt it to be the same as <I>kosmion</I>, 'ornament.' <I>Kosmos</I> is 'the world,' from the order which is in it. The tabernacle represented all this order, the pattern of heavenly things. Hence, if <I>kosmikon</I> be used, a neuter adjective for a substantive, or coined in this use, it would mean 'the holy order of the tabernacle, which represented the vast scene in which God's glory is displayed in Christ.' If not, we must say, 'and the sanctuary, a worldly one.' 'A worldly sanctuary' is not the sense. 'A worldly sanctuary' it is not, according to regular grammar and the constant usage of the Greek language.

The tabernacle is in view in Hebrews, not the temple; but the fact that offerings were then still made is recognized in what follows. He could not call it 'the present age' (a Jewish term for the age preceding the Messiah), because Messiah was come and he had been crucified; but the carnal ordinances were still offered, so that for the Hebrews it was not 'the age to come.' The 'image' could be only for a present time on earth. The patterns were in the heavens.
<DT><A NAME="9:9b">9:9i worshipped</A><DD><I>Latreuo</I>. 'Worship' is perhaps too strong, but 'service' is equivocal. It is to approach a god with prayers, or in offering up a religious service: see <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/heb?n=9:6">ver. 6</A>.
<DT><A NAME="9:11">9:11k come</A><DD>The 'good things to come' are the promised blessings to come in with Christ.

Having perfectly completed the work, he could sit down, and abide so, having done all; it is in contrast with the priests. They stood daily; he is set down 'for a continuance.'

<DT><A NAME="10:38">10:38d just</A><DD>Or possibly this may read 'my just <I>man</I>.' i.e. God's just one, the one he owns as such. There is good authority for it. The sense runs well and is the same.
<DT><A NAME="10:38a">10:38e he</A><DD>Or 'any one.' The apostle is contrasting two characters; the one who perishes, and the one who saves, preserves, his life (spiritually, of course). The professing Hebrews were in danger of drawing back. It is certain that in what the apostle <I>quotes</I> (<A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/hab?n=2:3~a=1">Hab. 2:3, 4</A>) there is no reference in the word 'he' to the just who lives by faith. The Hebrew and the LXX prove this. All through this Epistle the Hebrews who acknowledged Jesus as Messiah are treated as a people; that is, the whole people accepted on condition of believing. So Peter: 'but are now the people of God.' And here: 'Jesus, that he might sanctify the people with his own blood.' In this Epistle there is nothing of the sanctification of the Spirit; but the writer urges as a practical truth 'the just shall live by faith:' and then he says, 'and, if he draw back;' that is, any one holding this position of a professed believer; but if he was living by faith in him, <I>he</I> was not drawing back. In a word, drawing back is one character, living by faith another.

<DT><A NAME="11:13a">11:13e earth</A><DD>Or 'land.'
<DT><A NAME="11:17">11:17f himself</A><DD>The Greek implies the will or action of the person receiving. It is used only here and in <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/ac?n=28:7">Acts 28:7</A>. Publius received, 'took,' Paul and his company into his house. It has the sense of taking on oneself physically, or as a debt or responsibility. Abraham's own mind had taken up and appropriated the promises, and yet he gave up Isaac. It was not merely they were given and taken away, with which he had nothing to do; but he had adopted them by faith in his heart, and trusted God enough to give them up according to flesh.
<DT><A NAME="11:18">11:18g said</A><DD>See <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/ge?n=21:12">Gen. 21:12</A>.
<DT><A NAME="11:19">11:19h received</A><DD>The force of the Greek, thus applied, is to get back what one had, or what belonged to one, when it might have seemed lost for ever, as <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/mt?n=25:27">Matt. 25:27</A>. The sense I think quite certain in its application to Isaac's sacrifice. The aorist is constantly used in this chapter historically.

<DT><A NAME="11:25">11:25c choosing, 11:26 esteeming, 11:27 fearing</A><DD>These are aorists, but in English the present participle is joined to the perfect tense as characterizing the action. 'He refused ... choosing;' 'he refused ... having chosen' would make a different time of it, not the same. In Greek all is referred to the time of speaking.
<DT><A NAME="11:28">11:28d celebrated</A><DD>Here and <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/heb?n=11:17">ver. 17</A>, as to the offering up Isaac, the verbs are in the perfect; this is remarkable. The other facts are generally passing facts, part of the whole history; these are of standing significance, either figuratively setting the believer on a new ground, or viewed as continued till the time of the epistle: 'by faith Abraham has offered,' 'by faith he has celebrated;' only this is not possible in English. It was not external continuance, for the blood sprinkling was only once.
