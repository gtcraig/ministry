</TABLE>
<DIV CLASS=a><DL>
<DT><A NAME="1:1">1:1a at</A><DD>Lit. 'in,' as <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/ac?n=13:1">Acts 13:1</A>; <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/re?n=2:1">Rev. 2:1</A>.
<DT><A NAME="1:1a">1:1b Ephesus</A><DD>It may be interesting to mention that though 'at Ephesus' is found in almost all copies, many authorities would leave it out. Some, without sufficient ground, have considered it as a kind of circular. Compare <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/col?n=4:16">Col. 4:16</A>.
<DT><A NAME="1:3">1:3c with</A><DD>'With' does not quite give the force. The preposition (<I>en</I>) here conveys something of the power and value of what is enjoyed; gives the blessing characteristically: see <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mt?n=3:11a">Note c, Matt. 3:11</A>.
<DT><A NAME="1:5">1:5d beforehand</A><DD>The word translated 'marked out beforehand' involves purpose. It is not 'counsel,' though it is '<I>according to</I> the good pleasure of his will,' and, in <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/eph?n=1:11">ver. 11</A>, '<I>according to</I> his purpose,' and '<I>according to</I> the counsel of his own will.' The word <I>horizo</I> means 'mark out,' 'determine,' as in <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/ro?n=1:4">Rom. 1:4</A>; here <I>pro</I> (beforehand) is prefixed. It refers generally to persons, but is applied to things as in <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/1co?n=2:7">1Cor. 2:7</A>. When applied to persons, that to which they are destined is always added.
<DT><A NAME="1:5a">1:5e adoption</A><DD>Or 'sonship,' as <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/ga?n=4:5">Gal. 4:5</A>.
<DT><A NAME="1:6">1:6f favour</A><DD>'Taken us into his favour,' i.e. 'put us into a position of grace and favour.' The Greek word is used here and <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/lu?n=1:28">Luke 1:28</A>. 'Accepted us' is too formal a doctrine here. 'Shown us grace or favour' does not give the force, for then 'the Beloved' would be merely the instrument. It is 'in the Beloved' that we enter into favour. An alternative reading is, 'the favour or acceptance in grace, which he has freely bestowed upon us.'
<DT><A NAME="1:14">1:14g to</A><DD>Or 'up to,' <I>eis</I>. It is more than 'till,' because it has the inheritance in view. Compare <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/ga?n=3:24">Gal. 3:24</A>. It may be translated 'for the redemption,' connecting it with 'sealed,' instead of with 'earnest;' thus, 'Ye have been sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise, (who is the earnest of our inheritance,) for,' &amp;c.
<DT><A NAME="1:20">1:20a down</A><DD>'Set him down' is an added statement not connected <I>grammatically</I> with what precedes.
<DT><A NAME="1:22">1:22b feet</A><DD>See <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/ps?n=8:6">Ps. 8:6</A>.
<DT><A NAME="2:2">2:2c world</A><DD>'<I>Aion</I> of this <I>Kosmos</I>:' i.e. the course of this world; see Notes, <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/1co?n=1:20">1Cor. 1:20</A>.
<DT><A NAME="2:2a">2:2d disobedience</A><DD>As <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/eph?n=5:6">ch. 5:6</A>.
<DT><A NAME="2:3">2:3e do</A><DD>Not 'the will of the flesh and the thoughts,' but 'the things willed.'
<DT><A NAME="2:5">2:5f saved</A><DD>'Saved.' The perfect tense, not the principle on which we are saved, but the actual fact, what has been done and so abides: so <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/eph?n=2:8">ver. 8</A>.
<DT><A NAME="2:7">2:7g us</A><DD>That which is actually bestowed, not merely in the heart of God.
<DT><A NAME="2:12">2:12h God</A><DD>Or 'atheists.'
<DT><A NAME="2:21">2:21a <I>the</I></A><DD>I judge that the correct reading in the Greek is without the article. This construction directs the mind to all the component parts of the thing in question. So here the building is not viewed as one completed thing but was 'growing to' a temple (<I>naos</I>). He is looking at a building composed of living stones as a whole, but mentally apprehended as composed of many parts. Among these, in Christ, the Gentiles at Ephesus were built in too, to be now already a habitation of God by the presence of the Spirit.
<DT><A NAME="3:1">3:1b prisoner</A><DD>Lit. 'the one in bonds.'
<DT><A NAME="3:7">3:7c minister</A><DD><I>Diakonos</I>: see <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1co?n=4:1">Note, 1Cor. 4:1</A>.
<DT><A NAME="3:9">3:9d ages</A><DD>Or 'from eternity:' literally 'from the ages;' but in the sense of the period elapsed, not 'hidden from them.'
<DT><A NAME="3:11">3:11e ages</A><DD>Or 'eternal purpose.'
<DT><A NAME="3:14">3:14f Christ</A><DD>Many reject the words 'of our Lord Jesus Christ.' But as they are well supported by manuscripts and the most ancient versions and fathers I have not struck them out, though disposed to think them an addition.
<DT><A NAME="3:15">3:15g family</A><DD>There is a distinct connection between the Greek words for Father and family.
<DT><A NAME="3:21">3:21a Amen</A><DD><A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/eph?n=3">Ch. 3</A>, except <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/eph?n=3:1">ver. 1</A>, is a parenthesis.
<DT><A NAME="4:1">4:1b wherewith</A><DD>Or 'according to which.'
<DT><A NAME="4:3">4:3c bond</A><DD>It is not only 'bond,' but the 'bond-together.' It is not the power of union -- that is the Holy Spirit; but the practically uniting in fact, as amongst men on earth.
<DT><A NAME="4:4">4:4d body</A><DD>It may be translated '<I>the</I> body is one,' and so on. If we could leave out 'there is' or 'is', the force would be so much the greater.
<DT><A NAME="4:8">4:8e says</A><DD>See <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/ps?n=68:18">Ps. 68:18</A>.
<DT><A NAME="4:12">4:12f for</A><DD><I>Pros</I>: it directs attention to the object when reached, or when the subject is at, or with the object. 'The Word was with (<I>pros</I>) God,' <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/joh?n=1:1">John 1:1</A> <I>Eis</I> 'with a view to' here, and 'at' three times, <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/eph?n=4:13">ver. 13</A>, refers to the object in the <I>mind</I> of the person. See <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/mr?n=11:1">Mark 11:1</A>, where 'to' (twice) is <I>eis</I>, and 'at' is <I>pros</I>.
<DT><A NAME="4:12a">4:12g Christ</A><DD>Or 'of the Christ.'
<DT><A NAME="4:13">4:13h knowledge</A><DD>'Full knowledge,' as <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/eph?n=1:17">ch. 1:17</A>; <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/col?n=1:9">Col. 1:9</A>.
<DT><A NAME="4:14">4:14i in</A><DD>The form of the Greek phrase makes it somewhat difficult to translate. I do not think that the phrase 'in the sleight of,' &amp;c., is in connection with 'tossed and carried about,' but, in sense, with 'that teaching.' The cheating, as of dice-players, and still more methodic craft, characterized the teaching. 'In the sleight of men' marks the power and character of the teaching. What I have given is literal, and is sufficiently clear: 'that' is emphatic.
<DT><A NAME="4:16">4:16k supply</A><DD>The word 'supply' in Greek has the emphatic article and it might read 'that supply, <I>which is</I> according to.' The article denotes a known supply from Christ. sufficiently known to be referred to, to which also the 'from whom' lends force.
<DT><A NAME="4:17">4:17a as</A><DD>Lit. 'as also,' or 'even as.'
<DT><A NAME="4:21">4:21b in</A><DD>There is an emphatic article before 'Jesus:' 'Jesus' is personally brought into relief.
<DT><A NAME="4:22">4:22c conversation</A><DD>i.e. manner of life.
<DT><A NAME="4:22a">4:22d itself</A><DD>Or 'goes on in corruption.' The Greek word is used for 'destroy' in <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/1co?n=3:17">1Cor. 3:17</A>. The two thoughts combine here.
<DT><A NAME="4:24">4:24e holiness</A><DD>Lit. 'righteousness and holiness of the truth:' see <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/eph?n=4:21">ver. 21</A>.
<DT><A NAME="4:25">4:25f falsehood</A><DD>Everything that has the character and nature of falsehood. It is abstract, what has this quality, not merely the act of lying.
<DT><A NAME="4:27">4:27g for</A><DD>Or 'give way to.'
<DT><A NAME="4:29">4:29h corrupt</A><DD>Or 'filthy;' a figure drawn from what is evil and bad, as fruit: see <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/mt?n=7:17~a=1">Matt. 7:17-18</A> 'worthless.'
<DT><A NAME="4:30">4:30i for</A><DD><I>Eis</I>: see <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/eph?n=1:14">ch. 1:14</A>.
<DT><A NAME="4:32">4:32k kind</A><DD>As 'good,' <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/lu?n=6:35">Luke 6:35</A>; <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/1pe?n=2:3">1Pet. 2:3</A>.
<DT><A NAME="4:32a">4:32l forgiving, forgiven</A><DD>Or 'showing grace to,' 'shown grace to,' as <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/lu?n=7:42">Luke 7:42</A>.
<DT><A NAME="5:3">5:3m, 5:5m lust</A><DD>As 'greedy unsatisfied lust,' <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/eph?n=4:19">ch. 4:19</A>. It means the lust of having, but is not confined to gain: see <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/mr?n=7:22">Mark 7:22</A>.
<DT><A NAME="5:4">5:4n foolish</A><DD>Perhaps 'indecent.'
<DT><A NAME="5:4a">5:4o jesting</A><DD>Used for 'buffoonery.'
<DT><A NAME="5:4b">5:4p convenient</A><DD>'Convenient' has the French sense of <I>convenir</I> (see <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/col?n=3:18">Col. 3:18</A>, <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/phm?n=1:8">Philem. 8</A>, 'fitting'), but no other word exactly suits. Perhaps 'becoming' or 'suitable.'
<DT><A NAME="5:5">5:5q knowing</A><DD>'Informed of' is conscious knowledge; 'knowing' is objective knowledge.
<DT><A NAME="5:6">5:6a disobedience</A><DD><I>Apeitheia</I>: see <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/eph?n=2:2">ch. 2:2</A> and <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ro?n=10:21a">Note q, Rom. 10:21</A>.
<DT><A NAME="5:11">5:11b reprove, 5:13b exposed</A><DD>Or 'expose <I>them</I>' -- that is, expose (as by light) their true character. <I>Elenko</I>: see <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/joh?n=3:20">John 3:20</A>.
<DT><A NAME="5:13">5:13c things</A><DD>Or 'but all of them, having their true character exposed by the light, are made manifest,' or 'are made manifest by the light.'
<DT><A NAME="5:14">5:14d thee</A><DD>See <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/isa?n=60:1">Isa. 60:1</A>.
<DT><A NAME="5:16">5:16e time</A><DD>Not 'redeeming time,' as usually understood, but seizing every good and favourable opportunity. (See <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/da?n=2:8">Dan. 2:8</A>.)
<DT><A NAME="5:19">5:19f hymns</A><DD><I>Humnos</I>, as <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/col?n=3:16">Col. 3:16</A>. The verb <I>humneo</I>, from the same root, is found in <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/mt?n=26:30">Matt. 26:30</A>; <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/mr?n=14:26">Mark 14:26</A>; <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/ac?n=16:25">Acts 16:25</A>; and <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/heb?n=2:12">Heb. 2:12</A>.
<DT><A NAME="5:20">5:20g is</A><DD>'To him who is.' This alone gives the sense. 'God, even the Father,' might be taken as meaning that the Father only is God, and it is far from exact as a translation.
<DT><A NAME="5:23">5:23h husband</A><DD><I>Aner</I>, 'man,' when not the race, and 'husband' are the same word in Greek; but the article is left out here. It is in his character of man, as contrasted with woman, that this headship belongs to him. It is the same word as 'husband' in what follows, only there it has the article.
<DT><A NAME="5:23a">5:23i wife</A><DD>Or 'woman.'
<DT><A NAME="5:26">5:26k purifying</A><DD>Or having purified.' The aorists 'loved' -- 'delivered' -- 'sanctify' -- 'purifying' may be coincident or consequent one on another.
<DT><A NAME="5:31">5:31a be</A><DD>Lit 'to one flesh,' that is, shall become so, and so be accounted: see <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1co?n=6:16">Note, 1Cor. 6:16</A>.
<DT><A NAME="5:31a">5:31b flesh</A><DD>See <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/ge?n=2:24">Gen. 2:24</A>.
<DT><A NAME="6:3">6:3c earth</A><DD>See <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/ex?n=20:12">Ex. 20:12</A>; <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/de?n=5:16">Deut. 5:16</A>.
<DT><A NAME="6:11">6:11d on</A><DD>Aorist, meaning 'have it put on.'
<DT><A NAME="6:11a">6:11e panoply</A><DD>i.e. 'the complete armour.' The word is used only here and in <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/lu?n=11:22">Luke 11:22</A>.
<DT><A NAME="6:12">6:12f <I>power</I></A><DD>Or 'powers.'
<DT><A NAME="6:13">6:13g take</A><DD>'Take,' 'taken,' vers, 13 and 16, are aorists. The sense is 'taking up,' as arms or clothes to put on: taking a person with you, <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/2ti?n=4:11">2Tim. 4:11</A>.
<DT><A NAME="6:13a">6:13h things</A><DD>Or 'having overcome all things.' It is to 'carry through and put in execution all that is purposed and called for, in spite of opposition.'
<DT><A NAME="6:15">6:15i preparation</A><DD>Or 'readiness,' 'willingness,' 'preparedness.'
<DT><A NAME="6:16">6:16k inflamed</A><DD>Or 'burning:' such darts with burning stuff at the end were in use.
<DT><A NAME="6:17">6:17l Have</A><DD>Lit. 'receive' (aorist imperative). This is not as active or energetic a word as 'take,' <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/eph?n=6:13">vers. 13</A>, <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/eph?n=6:16">16</A>. Perhaps there is instruction in this.
<DT><A NAME="6:21">6:21a on</A><DD><I>Prasso</I>: the word seems to express both doing and state: see <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ro?n=1:32b">Note i, Rom. 1:32</A>.
<DT><A NAME="6:21a">6:21b minister</A><DD>Or 'servant' (<I>diakonos</I>), one that ministered to Paul as to the Lord, as <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/2co?n=6:4">2Cor. 6:4</A>.
