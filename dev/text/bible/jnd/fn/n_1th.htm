<DIV CLASS=a><DL>
<DT><A NAME="1:4">1:4a knowing</A><DD><I>Oida</I>, 'know consciously,' as throughout 1 and 2Thess., except <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/1th?n=3:5">1Thess. 3:5</A>.
<DT><A NAME="1:5">1:5b you</A><DD><I>Ginomai eis</I>: see <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/ga?n=3:14">Gal. 3:14</A>. Or 'brought to you.' It is passive, with the preposition, giving the sense of motion up to: 'they were now come.'
<DT><A NAME="1:9">1:9c serve</A><DD><I>Douleuo</I>: to serve as bondmen or slaves.
<DT><A NAME="1:10">1:10d deliverer</A><DD>See <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_lu?n=1:69">Note, Luke 1:71</A>.
<DT><A NAME="2:10">2:10e piously</A><DD>Or 'holily,' <I>hosios</I>: see 'gracious,' <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/ac?n=2:27">Acts 2:27</A>.
<DT><A NAME="2:12">2:12a calls</A><DD>Or 'the God who calls you:' but neither gives exactly the Greek, because 'of God, who calls' makes God stand by himself as such; and 'the God who calls' makes the calling too distinctive, so that, but for other reasons, one might think there was another God. The Greek preserves the absoluteness of God, and adds the calling quality.
<DT><A NAME="2:17">2:17b separated</A><DD>Lit. 'orphaned of.' The one Greek word has been translated 'bereaved ... and separated' to express the emphatic reiteration of the Greek preposition <I>apo</I>.
<DT><A NAME="2:19">2:19c also</A><DD>Or 'is it not even ye?'
<DT><A NAME="3:2">3:2d God</A><DD>The reading here is perplexing, but it is either as translated, or 'our brother and minister of God.'
<DT><A NAME="3:4">3:4e be</A><DD>Or 'we are to be,' that is, such is the lot of Christians; but 'told you beforehand' seems to make it applicable to the Thessalonians. I suspect both were in the apostle's mind; but it is added to <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/1th?n=3:3">ver. 3</A>, and not the repetition of it.
<DT><A NAME="3:6">3:6f us</A><DD>Or 'have good remembrance of us, always desiring much to see.'
<DT><A NAME="3:7">3:7g in</A><DD><I>Epi</I> with a dative. Here, and in <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/2co?n=7:7">2Cor. 7:7</A>, the apostle states what gave occasion for comfort to him -- the circumstance, not the cause. It is a similar construction in <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/1th?n=3:9">ver. 9</A>: 'for all the joy.' We can say 'for' perhaps there, but it is the occasion of his thanksgiving; his thanksgiving was conditional; that was necessary to it as a condition precedent.
<DT><A NAME="3:11">3:11a himself</A><DD>The one article in Greek refers 'God and Father' to one person, without necessarily referring 'our' to more than Father, which it follows in Greek. 'Now may himself <I>who is</I> God and our Father.'
<DT><A NAME="3:11a">3:11b direct</A><DD>Here 'direct' in Greek is in the singular; God the Father and Christ the Lord forming, so to speak, one in the apostle's mind, though, personally, clearly distinguished.
<DT><A NAME="3:12">3:12c you</A><DD>'You' is in contrast with 'our ... to you.'
<DT><A NAME="3:13">3:13d holiness</A><DD><I>Hagiosune</I>. See <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ro?n=1:4a">Note i at Rom. 1:4</A>.
<DT><A NAME="4:1">4:1e please</A><DD>I do not say 'to please,' because then pleasing God would be a distinct object. Here it is rather 'to walk so as to please.' The point is, the '<I>how</I>,' that is, the manner of doing it, not that it ought to be an object, however true that may be.
<DT><A NAME="4:3">4:3f will</A><DD>The article is not before 'will' in Greek, and the force is much increased thereby. It is not merely the fact that God wills so, but it is a matter of God's will. God is looked at as a person in authority (not merely a divine Being), but the will is looked at characteristically, not merely as a fact that he so wills. This is of such a character that God himself wills it.
<DT><A NAME="4:3a">4:3g, 4:4g, 4:7g sanctification</A><DD><I>Hagiasmos</I>. See <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ro?n=1:4a">Note i at Rom. 1:4</A>.
<DT><A NAME="4:4">4:4h possess</A><DD>The Greek is not, I think, 'acquire,' but 'come into possession of,' the difference being great in moral things. What I possess myself of, I possess when the action is complete and permanent. Thus <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/lu?n=18:12">Luke 18:12</A>; <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/lu?n=21:19">21:19</A>. You cannot say 'acquire your souls by patience.' 'Keep,' 'preserve,' is a kindred sense of the word.
<DT><A NAME="4:6">4:6i matter</A><DD>A mild expression for intercourse with a female, as his wife or another's.
<DT><A NAME="4:7">4:7k to</A><DD><I>Epi</I>, the characterizing condition: see <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/ro?n=10:19">Rom. 10:19</A>.
<DT><A NAME="4:12">4:12l one</A><DD>Or 'of nothing.'
<DT><A NAME="5:8">5:8a hope</A><DD>Compare <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/1co?n=13:13">1Cor. 13:13</A>: 'faith, hope, love, these three things.'
<DT><A NAME="5:22">5:22b wickedness</A><DD>The distinction between the expressions 'the right' and the word translated 'wickedness' (lit. 'evil') without an article is profoundly beautiful. The latter is looked at as a general thing, a genus, and has kinds or species. They were to hold fast '<I>the</I> right,' the thing in itself. But we cannot speak of evil in itself as an abstract existence. Its most absolute form is Satan (as 'the wicked one,' see <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/mt?n=13:19">Matt. 13:19</A>), though we may practically speak of 'evil,' but I cannot say 'evilness' as I can 'goodness.' I must suppose an existence of what is good to have an idea of evil. But if I say ' wickedness,' I think of an act or of evil will in someone, malice, and this gives the sense here.
