<DIV CLASS=a><DL>
<DT><A NAME="1:1">1:1b Christ</A><DD>Or, according to some authorities, 'Christ Jesus.'
<DT><A NAME="1:2">1:2c our</A><DD>Or 'the.'
<DT><A NAME="1:4">1:4d which</A><DD>' Not merely a relative pronoun, stating the fact, but the character. They are such as do so.
<DT><A NAME="1:4a">1:4e dispensation</A><DD>See <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_col?n=1:25">Note l, Col. 1:25</A>.
<DT><A NAME="1:5">1:5f enjoined</A><DD>This refers to <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/1ti?n=1:3">ver. 3</A>.
<DT><A NAME="1:5a">1:5g faith</A><DD>i.e. 'love out of a pure heart and (out of) a good conscience and (out of) unfeigned faith.'
<DT><A NAME="1:6">1:6h missed</A><DD>As <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/1ti?n=6:21">ch. 6:21</A>.
<DT><A NAME="1:9">1:9i application</A><DD>A technical word for the enactment of a law, its being in force.
<DT><A NAME="1:12">1:12k thank</A><DD>Or 'I am thankful to him who has given me power (<I>dunamis</I>), Christ Jesus our Lord.'
<DT><A NAME="1:12a">1:12a him</A><DD>Or 'appointing me to ministry (<I>diakonia</I>), who.'
<DT><A NAME="1:16">1:16b of</A><DD>As 'outline,' <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/2ti?n=1:13">2Tim. 1:13</A>. It is a mistake to confine delineation to long-suffering, and so make 'of' mean 'for:' 'for those,' &amp;c. Paul was a delineation of Christ's ways in <I>their</I> case, even, I doubt not, in the case of the rebellious Jews hereafter: the whole long-suffering was in Paul's case, so as to picture every case. In those who companied with Christ when alive this was not so, though the grace was really the same; but there was not the same showing forth of it.
<DT><A NAME="1:18">1:18c charge</A><DD>As 'enjoin,' <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/1ti?n=1:3">vers. 3</A>, <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/1ti?n=1:5">5</A>.
<DT><A NAME="1:18a">1:18d that</A><DD>I have left the ambiguity as in Greek. I apprehend the series of ideas in the apostle's mind is: he commits -- in order that; but he refers to the prophecies -- that by them. The 'as to thee' is more closely connected with prophecies.
<DT><A NAME="1:19">1:19e maintaining</A><DD>Or 'holding fast,' as <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/2ti?n=1:13">2Tim. 1:13</A>.
<DT><A NAME="1:19a">1:19f faith</A><DD>The word 'faith' embraces two ideas: doctrine, as taught of God and received; and subjectively the state of soul. If I have cast off the faith, the doctrine and the state of soul are both gone. Here 'faith' (first time) is the inward energy of grace which holds fast the truth. The two are not separated, but the state of the soul is first in the apostle's mind. In the second, they, having put away a good conscience, did not hold fast the faith, but lost it in some way thus objectively. In this second case, there is the article in Greek, which does not exclude faith in the soul, but leads the mind to the faith. In English 'the faith' would be too absolute or merely doctrinal.
<DT><A NAME="2:1">2:1g intercessions</A><DD>Personal and confiding intercourse with God on the part of one able to approach him, as <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/ro?n=8:27">Rom. 8:27</A>, <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/ro?n=8:34">34</A>; <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/heb?n=7:25">Heb. 7:25</A>.
<DT><A NAME="2:4">2:4h knowledge</A><DD><I>Epignosis</I>, as <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/col?n=1:10">Col. 1:10</A>, where it is translated 'true knowledge.' It is that which acknowledges the truth of a thing, and to know the truth thus suggests possession of it. But 'full knowledge' here would hardly be an appropriate translation, as it would imply a contrast with 'partial knowledge.'
<DT><A NAME="2:5">2:5i mediator</A><DD>Or 'there is one God and one mediator.'
<DT><A NAME="2:6">2:6k for</A><DD><I>Antilutron huper</I>: a ransom in place of.
<DT><A NAME="2:7">2:7l herald</A><DD>Or 'preacher,' as <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/2ti?n=1:11">2Tim. 1:11</A>; <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/2pe?n=2:5">2Pet. 2:5</A>.
<DT><A NAME="2:8">2:8m men</A><DD>i.e. men in contrast to women.
<DT><A NAME="2:8a">2:8a pious</A><DD><I>Hosios</I>, as 'holy,' <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/heb?n=7:26">Heb. 7:26</A>.
<DT><A NAME="2:9">2:9b dress</A><DD>The whole deportment; the way in which the woman presents herself, of which dress is a sign.
<DT><A NAME="2:9a">2:9c discretion</A><DD>i.e. 'sobriety' or with 'sound mind;' so <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/1ti?n=2:15">ver. 15</A>, as <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/ro?n=12:3">Rom. 12:3</A>; <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/2ti?n=1:7">2Tim. 1:7</A>.
<DT><A NAME="2:12">2:12d man</A><DD>Or 'a man.' It is in contrast with women, as in <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/1ti?n=2:8">ver. 8</A>.
<DT><A NAME="2:14">2:14e deceived</A><DD>A strong form of the word, but scriptural Greek often adds strengthening prepositions with the force little changed: see <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/ro?n=7:11">Rom. 7:11</A>; <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/ro?n=16:18">16:18</A>; <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/1co?n=3:18">1Cor. 3:18</A>; <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/2co?n=11:3">2Cor. 11:3</A>; <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/2th?n=2:3">2Thess. 2:3</A>, where the same Greek word is used.
<DT><A NAME="2:15">2:15f holiness</A><DD><I>Hagiasmos</I>. See <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ro?n=1:4a">Note i at Rom. 1:4</A>.
<DT><A NAME="3:2">3:2g discreet</A><DD>i.e. 'of sound mind,' as <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/1ti?n=2:9">ch. 2:9</A>.
<DT><A NAME="3:6">3:6h fault</A><DD><I>Krima</I> is the subject-matter of which a person had to be accused. They set up the <I>krima</I> of the Lord on the cross; that for which he came into accusation -- the charge. So it is used here. The devil was puffed up with his own excellency, and abode not in the truth. Hence, in a strongly taken sense, our word 'crime.' See also <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1co?n=11:29">Note on 1Cor. 11:29</A>.
<DT><A NAME="3:8">3:8i Ministers, 3:12i ministers</A><DD><I>Diakonos</I>, 'servants' or 'deacons:' see <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/ro?n=16:1">Rom. 16:1</A> and <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/1co?n=4:1">1Cor. 4:1</A>.
<DT><A NAME="3:10">3:10k minister, 3:13k ministered</A><DD><I>Diakoneo</I>, to serve, as servants or deacons.
<DT><A NAME="3:14">3:14l quickly</A><DD>More quickly than the writing of the letter supposed; but in case he delayed he wrote. The verse refers to his fears of being delayed.
<DT><A NAME="3:16">3:16m God</A><DD>I do not enter on the criticism of this text. It very likely should read 'He who has,' &amp;c.
<DT><A NAME="3:16a">3:16a to</A><DD>Or 'has been seen of.'
<DT><A NAME="4:2">4:2b speaking</A><DD>Or, perhaps, 'through those who speak lies,' &amp;c. Otherwise, as translated in text, the Spirit identifies the speaker and the evil spirit which speaks by him, as commonly in the New Testament, and passes from one to the other.
<DT><A NAME="4:3">4:3c know</A><DD>Or 'acknowledge:' from the same root as 'knowledge' in <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/1ti?n=2:4">ch. 2:4</A>.
<DT><A NAME="4:5">4:5d addressing</A><DD>It means 'intercourse with a person,' then 'petitions and intercession;' one person speaking personally to another. (See <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1ti?n=2:1">Note, ch. 2:1</A>, same Greek word.) The creature, fallen through Adam, belongs to the faithful, and those who know the truth, by God's speaking to them, and their freely speaking to him. This has set all on a new footing, because we have met God again, the word of God having put us into communication by grace. And the 'faithful, and those who know the truth,' have availed themselves of it, and come and enter into intercourse. It is no longer by nature, but by the word of God.
<DT><A NAME="4:6">4:6e minister</A><DD>Or 'servant,' <I>diakonos</I>, as <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/1ti?n=3:8">ch. 3:8</A>.
<DT><A NAME="4:6a">4:6f up</A><DD>Or 'been thoroughly acquainted with:' see <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/lu?n=1:3">Luke 1:3</A>; <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/2ti?n=3:10">2Tim. 3:10</A>.
<DT><A NAME="4:8">4:8g little</A><DD>That is, 'some small thing,' rather than 'a little time.' It is in evident contrast with 'everything.'
<DT><A NAME="4:12">4:12h conduct</A><DD>Or 'conversation,' i.e. manner of life.
<DT><A NAME="4:13">4:13i reading</A><DD>Or 'reading out' (to others).
<DT><A NAME="4:14">4:14k of</A><DD>See <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_heb?n=2:3">Note r, Heb. 2:3</A>.
<DT><A NAME="4:15">4:15l them</A><DD>Compare <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/lu?n=2:49">Luke 2:49</A>, 'be occupied in.'
<DT><A NAME="5:13">5:13a houses</A><DD>The word 'people's' is not in the original, but has been added to represent the article in the Greek. It means 'going from house to house.'
<DT><A NAME="5:14">5:14b respect</A><DD>Or 'by reason of.' The sense is, the favour borne to anything; sometimes it is an object, sometimes a pleasing motive. The adversary found in the reproach a motive to exercise his hostility. As to 'adversary,' the habit of Paul is to speak thus of Satan directly when acting through men, because he knew the activity of the adversary, and the part he takes in such matters. To such an adversary reproach is a favoured, accepted motive.
<DT><A NAME="5:18">5:18c says</A><DD>See <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/de?n=25:4">Deut. 25:4</A>.
<DT><A NAME="5:18a">5:18d hire</A><DD>See <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/lu?n=10:7">Luke 10:7</A>.
<DT><A NAME="5:20">5:20e convict</A><DD>Or 'reprove.' <I>Elenko</I>; to bring home a fault demonstratively to a man's conscience; 'to put to shame,' 'conquer,' 'rebuke,' but with conviction: see <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_joh?n=3:20">Note d, John 3:20</A>.
<DT><A NAME="6:1">6:1f masters</A><DD><I>Despotes</I>: see <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/ac?n=4:24">Acts 4:24</A>; 'serve,' <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/1ti?n=6:2">ver. 2</A>, is <I>douleuo</I>.
<DT><A NAME="6:2a">6:2a faithful</A><DD>Or 'believing,' the same as in the beginning of the verse.
<DT><A NAME="6:5">6:5b piety</A><DD>'Withdraw from such,' as A.V., omitted as having but little MS. authority.
<DT><A NAME="6:8">6:8c content</A><DD>Or 'let us be satisfied.'
<DT><A NAME="6:9">6:9d desire</A><DD>'Desire' includes the idea of purpose here.
<DT><A NAME="6:10">6:10e <I>the</I></A><DD>There is no article in the Greek. It is not that there is no other root, but the love of money is characterized by being such.
<DT><A NAME="6:12">6:12f faith</A><DD>Or 'combat of the faith.'
<DT><A NAME="6:12a">6:12g hold</A><DD>As 'seize,' <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/ac?n=16:19">Acts 16:19</A>; 'caught hold,' <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/mt?n=14:31">Matt. 14:31</A>.
<DT><A NAME="6:15">6:15h time</A><DD>Lit. 'times,' as <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/1ti?n=2:6">ch. 2:6</A>.
<DT><A NAME="6:21">6:21i missed</A><DD>'To miss the mark,' or 'not give heed to;' it is to fail in shooting, and metaphorically in one's purpose, or to have erred. See <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/1ti?n=1:6">ch. 1:6</A> and <A HREF="/cgi-bin/br/BDB/2ti?n=2:18">2Tim. 2:18</A>.
