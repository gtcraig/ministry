<H2>Chapter 1</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="1:1">1:1</A><DD>Forasmuch as many have undertaken to draw up a relation concerning the matters fully believed among us,
<DT><A NAME="1:2">1:2</A><DD>as those who from the beginning were eye-witnesses of and <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_lu?n=1:2">attendants</A> on the Word have delivered them to us,
<DT><A NAME="1:3">1:3</A><DD>it has seemed good to *me* also, accurately acquainted from the origin with all things, to write to thee with method, most excellent Theophilus,
<DT><A NAME="1:4">1:4</A><DD>that thou mightest know the certainty of those things in which thou hast been instructed.
<DT><A NAME="1:5">1:5</A><DD>There was in the days of Herod, the king of Judaea, a certain priest, by name Zacharias, of the course of Abia, and his wife of the daughters of Aaron, and her name Elizabeth.
<DT><A NAME="1:6">1:6</A><DD>And they were both just before God, walking in all the commandments and <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_lu?n=1:6">ordinances</A> of the Lord blameless.
<DT><A NAME="1:7">1:7</A><DD>And they had no child, because Elizabeth was barren, and they were both advanced in <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_lu?n=1:7">years</A>.
<DT><A NAME="1:8">1:8</A><DD>And it came to pass, as he fulfilled his priestly service before God in the order of his course,
<DT><A NAME="1:9">1:9</A><DD>it fell to him by lot, according to the custom of the priesthood, to enter into the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_lu?n=1:9">temple</A> of the Lord to burn incense.
<DT><A NAME="1:10">1:10</A><DD>And all the multitude of the people were praying without at the hour of incense.
<DT><A NAME="1:11">1:11</A><DD>And an angel of <I>the</I> Lord appeared to him, standing on the right of the altar of incense.
<DT><A NAME="1:12">1:12</A><DD>And Zacharias was troubled, seeing <I>him</I>, and fear fell upon him.
<DT><A NAME="1:13">1:13</A><DD>But the angel said to him, Fear not, Zacharias, because thy supplication has been heard, and thy wife Elizabeth shall bear thee a son, and thou shalt call his name <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_lu?n=1:13">John</A>.
<DT><A NAME="1:14">1:14</A><DD>And he shall be to thee <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_lu?n=1:14">joy</A> and rejoicing, and many shall rejoice at his birth.
<DT><A NAME="1:15">1:15</A><DD>For he shall be great before <I>the</I> <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_lu?n=1:15">Lord</A>, and he shall drink no wine nor strong drink; and he shall be filled with <I>the</I> Holy Spirit, even <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_lu?n=1:15a">from</A> his mother's womb.
<DT><A NAME="1:16">1:16</A><DD>And many of the sons of Israel shall he turn to <I>the</I> <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_lu?n=1:15">Lord</A> their God.
<DT><A NAME="1:17">1:17</A><DD>And *he* shall go before him in <I>the</I> spirit and power of Elias, to turn hearts of fathers to children, and disobedient ones <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_lu?n=1:17">to</A> <I>the</I> thoughts of just <I>men</I>, to make ready for <I>the</I> <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_lu?n=1:15">Lord</A> a prepared people.
<DT><A NAME="1:18">1:18</A><DD>And Zacharias said to the angel, How shall I know this, for *I* am an old man, and my wife advanced in <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_lu?n=1:18">years</A>?
<DT><A NAME="1:19">1:19</A><DD>And the angel answering, said to him, *I* am Gabriel, who stand before God, and I have been sent to speak to thee, and to bring these glad <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_lu?n=1:19">tidings</A> to thee;
<DT><A NAME="1:20">1:20</A><DD>and behold, thou shalt be silent and not able to speak, till the day in which these things shall take place, because thou hast not believed my words, the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_lu?n=1:20">which</A> shall be fulfilled in their time.
<DT><A NAME="1:21">1:21</A><DD>And the people were awaiting Zacharias, and they wondered at his delaying in the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_lu?n=1:9">temple</A>.
<DT><A NAME="1:22">1:22</A><DD>But when he came out he could not speak to them, and they <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_lu?n=1:22">recognised</A> that he had seen a vision in the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_lu?n=1:9">temple</A>. And he was making signs to them, and continued dumb.
<DT><A NAME="1:23">1:23</A><DD>And it came to pass, when the days of his service were completed, he departed to his house.
<DT><A NAME="1:24">1:24</A><DD>Now after these days, Elizabeth his wife conceived, and hid herself five months, saying,
<DT><A NAME="1:25">1:25</A><DD>Thus has <I>the</I> <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_lu?n=1:15">Lord</A> done to me in <I>these</I> days in which he looked upon <I>me</I> to take away my reproach among men.
<DT><A NAME="1:26">1:26</A><DD>But in the sixth month, the angel Gabriel was sent of God to a city of Galilee, of which <I>the</I> name <I>was</I> Nazareth,
<DT><A NAME="1:27">1:27</A><DD>to a virgin betrothed to a man whose name <I>was</I> Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin's name <I>was</I> Mary.
<DT><A NAME="1:28">1:28</A><DD>And the angel came in to her, and said, Hail, <I>thou</I> favoured one! the Lord <I>is</I> with thee: <I>blessed art *thou* amongst women</I>.
<DT><A NAME="1:29">1:29</A><DD>But she, <I>seeing</I> <I>the angel</I>, was troubled at his word, and reasoned in her mind <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_lu?n=1:29">what</A> this salutation might be.
<DT><A NAME="1:30">1:30</A><DD>And the angel said to her, Fear not, Mary, for thou hast found favour with God;
<DT><A NAME="1:31">1:31</A><DD>and behold, thou shalt conceive in the womb and bear a son, and thou shalt call his name Jesus.
<DT><A NAME="1:32">1:32</A><DD>*He* shall be great, and shall be called Son of <I>the</I> <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_lu?n=1:32">Highest</A>; and <I>the</I> Lord <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_lu?n=1:32a">God</A> shall give him the throne of David his father;
<DT><A NAME="1:33">1:33</A><DD>and he shall reign over the house of Jacob for the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_lu?n=1:33">ages</A>, and of his kingdom there shall not be an end.
<DT><A NAME="1:34">1:34</A><DD>But Mary said to the angel, How shall this be, <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_lu?n=1:34">since</A> I know not a man?
<DT><A NAME="1:35">1:35</A><DD>And the angel answering said to her, <I>The</I> Holy Spirit shall come upon thee, and power of <I>the</I> Highest overshadow thee, wherefore the holy thing also which shall be <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_lu?n=1:35">born</A> shall be called Son of God.
<DT><A NAME="1:36">1:36</A><DD>And behold, Elizabeth, thy kinswoman, she also has conceived a son in her old age, and this is the sixth month to her that was called barren:
<DT><A NAME="1:37">1:37</A><DD>for nothing shall be impossible with God.
<DT><A NAME="1:38">1:38</A><DD>And Mary said, Behold the bondmaid of <I>the</I> <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_lu?n=1:38">Lord</A>; be it to me according to thy word. And the angel departed from her.
<DT><A NAME="1:39">1:39</A><DD>And Mary, rising up in those days, went into the hill country with haste, to a city of Judah,
<DT><A NAME="1:40">1:40</A><DD>and entered into the house of Zacharias, and saluted Elizabeth.
<DT><A NAME="1:41">1:41</A><DD>And it came to pass, as Elizabeth heard the salutation of Mary, the babe leaped in her womb; and Elizabeth was filled with <I>the</I> Holy Spirit,
<DT><A NAME="1:42">1:42</A><DD>and cried out with a loud voice and said, Blessed <I>art</I> *thou* amongst women, and blessed the fruit of thy womb.
<DT><A NAME="1:43">1:43</A><DD>And whence <I>is</I> this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?
<DT><A NAME="1:44">1:44</A><DD>For behold, as the voice of thy salutation <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_lu?n=1:44">sounded</A> in my ears, the babe leaped with joy in my womb.
<DT><A NAME="1:45">1:45</A><DD>And blessed <I>is</I> she that has believed, for there shall be a fulfilment of the things spoken to her from <I>the</I> <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_lu?n=1:38">Lord</A>.
<DT><A NAME="1:46">1:46</A><DD>And Mary said, My soul magnifies the Lord,
<DT><A NAME="1:47">1:47</A><DD>and my spirit has rejoiced in God my Saviour.
<DT><A NAME="1:48">1:48</A><DD>For he has looked upon the low estate of his bondmaid; for behold, from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed.
<DT><A NAME="1:49">1:49</A><DD>For the Mighty One has done to me great things, and holy <I>is</I> his name;
<DT><A NAME="1:50">1:50</A><DD>and his mercy <I>is</I> to generations and generations to them that fear him.
<DT><A NAME="1:51">1:51</A><DD>He has wrought strength with his arm; he has scattered haughty <I>ones</I> in the thought of their heart.
<DT><A NAME="1:52">1:52</A><DD>He has put down rulers from thrones, and exalted the lowly.
<DT><A NAME="1:53">1:53</A><DD>He has filled the hungry with good things, and sent away the rich empty.
<DT><A NAME="1:54">1:54</A><DD>He has helped Israel his servant, in order to remember mercy,
<DT><A NAME="1:55">1:55</A><DD>(as he spoke to our fathers,) to Abraham and to his seed for ever.
<DT><A NAME="1:56">1:56</A><DD>And Mary abode with her about three months, and returned to her house.
<DT><A NAME="1:57">1:57</A><DD>But the time was fulfilled for Elizabeth that she should bring forth, and she gave birth to a son.
<DT><A NAME="1:58">1:58</A><DD>And her neighbours and kinsfolk heard that <I>the</I> <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_lu?n=1:38">Lord</A> had magnified his mercy with her, and they rejoiced with her.
<DT><A NAME="1:59">1:59</A><DD>And it came to pass on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child, and they called it after the name of his father, Zacharias.
<DT><A NAME="1:60">1:60</A><DD>And his mother answering said, No; but he shall be called John.
<DT><A NAME="1:61">1:61</A><DD>And they said to her, There is no one among thy kinsfolk who is called by this name.
<DT><A NAME="1:62">1:62</A><DD>And they made signs to his father as to what he might wish it to be called.
<DT><A NAME="1:63">1:63</A><DD>And having asked for a writing-table, he wrote saying, John is his name. And they all wondered.
<DT><A NAME="1:64">1:64</A><DD>And his mouth was opened immediately, and his tongue, and he spake, blessing God.
<DT><A NAME="1:65">1:65</A><DD>And fear came upon all who dwelt round about them; and in the whole hill-country of Judaea all these things were the subject of conversation.
<DT><A NAME="1:66">1:66</A><DD>And all who heard them laid them up in their heart, saying, What then will this child be? And <I>the</I> <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_lu?n=1:66">Lord's</A> hand was with him.
<DT><A NAME="1:67">1:67</A><DD>And Zacharias his father was filled with <I>the</I> Holy Spirit, and prophesied, saying,
<DT><A NAME="1:68">1:68</A><DD>Blessed be <I>the</I> <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_lu?n=1:66">Lord</A> the God of Israel, because he has visited and wrought redemption for his people,
<DT><A NAME="1:69">1:69</A><DD>and raised up a horn of <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_lu?n=1:69">deliverance</A> for us in the house of David his servant;
<DT><A NAME="1:70">1:70</A><DD>as he spoke by <I>the</I> mouth of his holy prophets, who have been since the world began;
<DT><A NAME="1:71">1:71</A><DD><A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_lu?n=1:69">deliverance</A> from our enemies and out of the hand of all who hate us;
<DT><A NAME="1:72">1:72</A><DD>to <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_lu?n=1:72">fulfil</A> mercy with our fathers and remember his holy covenant,
<DT><A NAME="1:73">1:73</A><DD><I>the</I> oath which he swore to Abraham our father,
<DT><A NAME="1:74">1:74</A><DD>to give us, that, saved out of the hand of our enemies, we should serve him without fear
<DT><A NAME="1:75">1:75</A><DD>in piety and righteousness before him all our days.
<DT><A NAME="1:76">1:76</A><DD>And *thou*, child, shalt be called <I>the</I> prophet of <I>the</I> Highest; for thou shalt go before the face of <I>the</I> <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_lu?n=1:66">Lord</A> to make ready his ways;
<DT><A NAME="1:77">1:77</A><DD>to give knowledge of <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_lu?n=1:69">deliverance</A> to his people by <I>the</I> remission of their sins
<DT><A NAME="1:78">1:78</A><DD>on account of <I>the</I> bowels of mercy of our God; wherein <I>the</I> <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_lu?n=1:78">dayspring</A> from on high has visited us,
<DT><A NAME="1:79">1:79</A><DD>to shine upon them who were sitting in darkness and in <I>the</I> shadow of death, to guide our feet into <I>the</I> way of peace.
<DT><A NAME="1:80">1:80</A><DD>-- And the child grew and was strengthened in spirit; and he was in the deserts until the day of his shewing to Israel.
</DL></DIV><H2>Chapter 2</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="2:1">2:1</A><DD>But it came to pass in those days that a decree went out from Caesar Augustus, that a <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_lu?n=2:1">census</A> should be made of all the habitable world.
<DT><A NAME="2:2">2:2</A><DD>The census itself first took place when Cyrenius had the government of Syria.
<DT><A NAME="2:3">2:3</A><DD>And all went to be inscribed in the census <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_lu?n=2:1">roll</A>, each to his own city:
<DT><A NAME="2:4">2:4</A><DD>and Joseph also went up from Galilee out of the city Nazareth to Judaea, to David's <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_lu?n=2:4">city</A>, the which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and family of David,
<DT><A NAME="2:5">2:5</A><DD>to be inscribed in the census <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_lu?n=2:1">roll</A> with Mary who was betrothed to him <I>as his</I> wife, she being great with child.
<DT><A NAME="2:6">2:6</A><DD>And it came to pass, while they were there, the days of her giving birth <I>to her child</I> were fulfilled,
<DT><A NAME="2:7">2:7</A><DD>and she brought forth her first-born son, and wrapped him up in swaddling-clothes and laid him in the manger, because there was no room for them in the inn.
<DT><A NAME="2:8">2:8</A><DD>And there were shepherds in that country abiding without, and keeping watch by night over their flock.
<DT><A NAME="2:9">2:9</A><DD>And lo, an angel of <I>the</I> <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_lu?n=2:9">Lord</A> was there <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_lu?n=2:9a">by</A> them, and <I>the</I> glory of <I>the</I> <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_lu?n=2:9">Lord</A> shone around them, and they feared <I>with</I> great fear.
<DT><A NAME="2:10">2:10</A><DD>And the angel said to them, Fear not, for behold, I announce to you glad tidings of great joy, which shall be to all the people;
<DT><A NAME="2:11">2:11</A><DD>for to-day a Saviour has been born to you in David's city, who is Christ <I>the</I> Lord.
<DT><A NAME="2:12">2:12</A><DD>And this is the sign to you: ye shall find a babe wrapped in swaddling-clothes, and lying in a manger.
<DT><A NAME="2:13">2:13</A><DD>And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host, praising God and saying,
<DT><A NAME="2:14">2:14</A><DD>Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_lu?n=2:14">pleasure</A> in men.
<DT><A NAME="2:15">2:15</A><DD>And it came to pass, as the angels departed from them into heaven, that the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_lu?n=2:15">shepherds</A> said to one another, Let us make our way then now as far as Bethlehem, and let us see this thing that is come to pass, which the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_lu?n=2:9">Lord</A> has made known to us.
<DT><A NAME="2:16">2:16</A><DD>And they came with haste, and found both Mary and Joseph, and the babe lying in the manger;
<DT><A NAME="2:17">2:17</A><DD>and having seen <I>it</I> they made known about the country the thing which had been said to them concerning this child.
<DT><A NAME="2:18">2:18</A><DD>And all who heard <I>it</I> wondered at the things said to them by the shepherds.
<DT><A NAME="2:19">2:19</A><DD>But Mary kept all these things <I>in her mind</I>, pondering <I>them</I> in her heart.
<DT><A NAME="2:20">2:20</A><DD>And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all things which they had heard and seen, as it had been said to them.
<DT><A NAME="2:21">2:21</A><DD>And when eight days were fulfilled for circumcising him, his name was called Jesus, which was the name given by the angel before he had been conceived in the womb.

<DT><A NAME="23:10">23:10</A><DD>And the chief priests and the scribes stood and accused him violently.

<DT><A NAME="23:21">23:21</A><DD>But they cried out in reply saying, Crucify, crucify him.
<DT><A NAME="23:22">23:22</A><DD>And he said the third time to them, What evil then has this <I>man</I> done? I have found no cause of death in him: I will chastise him therefore and release him.
<DT><A NAME="23:23">23:23</A><DD>But they were urgent with loud voices, begging that he might be crucified. And their voices <I>and those of the chief priests</I> prevailed.
<DT><A NAME="23:24">23:24</A><DD>And Pilate adjudged that what they begged should take place.
<DT><A NAME="23:25">23:25</A><DD>And he released him who, for tumult and murder, had been cast into prison, whom they begged for, and Jesus he delivered up to their will.
<DT><A NAME="23:26">23:26</A><DD>And as they led him away, they laid hold on a certain Simon, a Cyrenian, coming from the field, and put the cross upon him to bear it behind Jesus.
<DT><A NAME="23:27">23:27</A><DD>And a great multitude of the people, and of women who wailed and lamented him, followed him.
<DT><A NAME="23:28">23:28</A><DD>And Jesus turning round to them said, <FONT CLASS=r>Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep over me, but weep over yourselves and over your children;</FONT>

<DT><A NAME="23:32">23:32</A><DD>Now two others also, malefactors, were led with him to be put to death.

<DT><A NAME="23:36">23:36</A><DD>And the soldiers also made game of him, coming up offering him vinegar,

<DT><A NAME="23:40">23:40</A><DD>But the other answering rebuked him, saying, Dost *thou* too not fear God, thou that art under the same judgment?
<DT><A NAME="23:41">23:41</A><DD>and *we* indeed justly, for we receive the just recompense of what we have done; but this <I>man</I> has done nothing amiss.

<DT><A NAME="23:44">23:44</A><DD>And it was about <I>the</I> sixth hour, and there came darkness over the whole <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_lu?n=23:44">land</A> until <I>the</I> ninth hour.

<DT><A NAME="24:35">24:35</A><DD>And they related what <I>had happened</I> on the way, and how he was made known to them in the breaking of <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_lu?n=24:35">bread</A>.
<DT><A NAME="24:36">24:36</A><DD>And as they were saying these things, he himself stood in their midst, and says to them, <FONT CLASS=r>Peace <I>be</I> unto you.</FONT>
<DT><A NAME="24:37">24:37</A><DD>But they, being confounded and being frightened, supposed they beheld a spirit.
<DT><A NAME="24:38">24:38</A><DD>And he said to them, <FONT CLASS=r>Why are ye troubled? and why are thoughts rising in your hearts?</FONT>
<DT><A NAME="24:39">24:39</A><DD><FONT CLASS=r>behold my hands and my feet, that it is *I* myself. Handle me and see, for a spirit has not flesh and bones as ye see me having.</FONT>
<DT><A NAME="24:40">24:40</A><DD>And having said this he shewed them his hands and his feet.
<DT><A NAME="24:41">24:41</A><DD>But while they yet did not believe for joy, and were wondering, he said to them, <FONT CLASS=r>Have ye anything here to eat?</FONT>
<DT><A NAME="24:42">24:42</A><DD>And they <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_lu?n=24:42">gave</A> him part of a broiled fish and of a honeycomb;
<DT><A NAME="24:43">24:43</A><DD>and he took <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_lu?n=24:43">it</A> and ate before them.
<DT><A NAME="24:44">24:44</A><DD>And he said to them, <FONT CLASS=r>These <I>are</I> the words which I spoke to you while I was yet with you, that all that is written concerning me in the law of Moses and prophets and psalms must be fulfilled.</FONT>
<DT><A NAME="24:45">24:45</A><DD>Then he opened their understanding to understand the scriptures,
<DT><A NAME="24:46">24:46</A><DD>and said to them, <FONT CLASS=r>Thus it is written, and thus it behoved the Christ to suffer, and to rise from among the dead the third day;</FONT>
<DT><A NAME="24:47">24:47</A><DD><FONT CLASS=r>and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name to all the nations beginning at Jerusalem.</FONT>
<DT><A NAME="24:48">24:48</A><DD><FONT CLASS=r>And *ye* are witnesses of these things.</FONT>
<DT><A NAME="24:49">24:49</A><DD><FONT CLASS=r>And behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you; but do ye remain in the city till ye be clothed with power from on high.</FONT>
<DT><A NAME="24:50">24:50</A><DD>And he led them out as far as Bethany, and having lifted up his hands, he blessed them.
<DT><A NAME="24:51">24:51</A><DD>And it came to pass as he was blessing them, he was separated from them and was carried up into heaven.
<DT><A NAME="24:52">24:52</A><DD>And *they*, having done him homage, returned to Jerusalem with great joy,
<DT><A NAME="24:53">24:53</A><DD>and were continually in the temple praising and blessing God.
