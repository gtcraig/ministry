<DT><A NAME="1:1">1:1</A><DD><A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mal?n=1:1">*</A> The burden of the word of Jehovah to Israel by Malachi.
<DT><A NAME="1:2">1:2</A><DD>I have loved you, saith Jehovah; but ye say, Wherein hast thou loved us? Was not Esau Jacob's brother? saith Jehovah, and I loved Jacob,
<DT><A NAME="1:3">1:3</A><DD>and I hated Esau; and made his mountains a desolation, and <I>gave</I> his inheritance to the jackals of the wilderness.
<DT><A NAME="1:4">1:4</A><DD>If Edom say, We are broken down, but we will build again the ruined places, -- thus saith Jehovah of hosts: They shall build, but I will throw down; and <I>men</I> shall call them the territory of wickedness, and the people against whom Jehovah hath indignation for ever.
<DT><A NAME="1:5">1:5</A><DD>And your eyes shall see <I>it</I>, and ye shall say, Jehovah is magnified beyond the border of Israel.
<DT><A NAME="1:6">1:6</A><DD>A son honoureth <I>his</I> father, and a servant his master: if then I be a father, where is mine honour? and if I be a master, where is my fear? saith Jehovah of hosts unto you, priests, that despise my name. But ye say, Wherein have we despised thy name?
<DT><A NAME="1:7">1:7</A><DD>Ye <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mal?n=1:7">offer</A> polluted bread upon mine altar; and ye say, Wherein have we polluted thee? In that ye say, The table of Jehovah is contemptible.
<DT><A NAME="1:8">1:8</A><DD>And if ye offer the blind for sacrifice, is it not evil? And if ye offer the lame and sick, is it not evil? Present it now unto thy governor: will he be pleased with thee? or will he accept thy person? saith Jehovah of hosts.
<DT><A NAME="1:9">1:9</A><DD>And now, I pray you, beseech ùGod that he will be gracious unto us. This hath been of your hand: will he accept any of your persons? saith Jehovah of hosts.
<DT><A NAME="1:10">1:10</A><DD>Who is there among you that would even shut the doors? and ye would not kindle <I>fire</I> on mine altar for nothing. I have no delight in you, saith Jehovah of hosts, neither will I <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mal?n=1:10">accept</A> an oblation at your hand.
<DT><A NAME="1:11">1:11</A><DD>For from the rising of the sun even unto its setting my name shall be great among the nations; and in every place incense shall be offered unto my name, and a pure oblation: for my name shall be great among the nations, saith Jehovah of hosts.
<DT><A NAME="1:12">1:12</A><DD>But ye profane it, in that ye say, The table of the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mal?n=1:12">Lord</A> is polluted; and the fruit thereof, his food, is contemptible.
<DT><A NAME="1:13">1:13</A><DD>And ye say, Behold, what a weariness! And ye have puffed at it, saith Jehovah of hosts, and ye bring <I>that which was</I> <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mal?n=1:13">torn</A>, and the lame, and the sick; thus ye bring the oblation: should I <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mal?n=1:10">accept</A> this of your hand? saith Jehovah.
<DT><A NAME="1:14">1:14</A><DD>Yea, cursed be the deceiver, who hath in his flock a male, and voweth and sacrificeth unto the Lord a corrupt thing; for I am a great King, saith Jehovah of hosts, and my name is <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mal?n=1:14">terrible</A> among the nations.
</DL></DIV><H2>Chapter 2</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="2:1">2:1</A><DD>And now, ye priests, this commandment is for you.
<DT><A NAME="2:2">2:2</A><DD>If ye do not hear, and if ye do not lay <I>it</I> to heart, to give glory unto my name, saith Jehovah of hosts, I will even send the curse among you, and I will curse your blessings: yea, I have already cursed them, because ye do not lay <I>it</I> to heart.
<DT><A NAME="2:3">2:3</A><DD>Behold, I will rebuke your seed, and spread dung upon your faces, the dung of your feasts; and they shall take you away with it.
<DT><A NAME="2:4">2:4</A><DD>And ye shall know that I have sent this commandment unto you, that my covenant might be with Levi, saith Jehovah of hosts.
<DT><A NAME="2:5">2:5</A><DD>My covenant with him was of life and peace, and I gave them to him that he might fear; and he feared me, and trembled before my name.
<DT><A NAME="2:6">2:6</A><DD>The law of truth was in his mouth, and unrighteousness was not found in his lips: he walked with me in peace and uprightness, and he turned many from iniquity.
<DT><A NAME="2:7">2:7</A><DD>For the priest's lips should keep knowledge, and at his mouth they <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mal?n=2:7">seek</A> the law; for he is the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mal?n=2:7a">messenger</A> of Jehovah of hosts.
<DT><A NAME="2:8">2:8</A><DD>But ye are departed out of the way; ye have caused many to stumble at the law; ye have corrupted the covenant of Levi, saith Jehovah of hosts.
<DT><A NAME="2:9">2:9</A><DD>And I also have made you contemptible and base before all the people, because ye have not kept my ways, but have respect of persons in <I>administering</I> the law.
<DT><A NAME="2:10">2:10</A><DD>Have we not all one father? Hath not one ùGod created us? Why do we deal unfaithfully every man against his brother, by profaning the covenant of our fathers?
<DT><A NAME="2:11">2:11</A><DD>Judah hath dealt unfaithfully, and an abomination is committed in Israel and in Jerusalem; for Judah hath profaned the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mal?n=2:11">sanctuary</A> of Jehovah which he loved, and hath married the daughter of a strange ùgod.
<DT><A NAME="2:12">2:12</A><DD>Jehovah will cut off from the tents of Jacob the man that doeth this, him that calleth and him that <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mal?n=2:12">answereth</A>; and him that offereth an oblation unto Jehovah of hosts.
<DT><A NAME="2:13">2:13</A><DD>And <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mal?n=2:13">further</A> ye do this: ye cover the altar of Jehovah with tears, with weeping, and with sighing, insomuch that he regardeth not the oblation any more, nor receiveth <I>it</I> with satisfaction at your hand.
<DT><A NAME="2:14">2:14</A><DD>Yet ye say, Wherefore? Because Jehovah hath been a witness between thee and the wife of thy youth, against whom thou hast dealt unfaithfully: yet is she thy companion, and the wife of thy covenant.
<DT><A NAME="2:15">2:15</A><DD>And did not one make <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mal?n=2:15"><I>them</I></A>? and the remnant of the Spirit was his. And wherefore the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mal?n=2:15a">one</A>? He sought a seed of God. Take heed then to your spirit, and let none deal unfaithfully against the wife of his youth,
<DT><A NAME="2:16">2:16</A><DD>(for I hate putting away, saith Jehovah the God of Israel;) and he covereth with violence his <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mal?n=2:16">garment</A>, saith Jehovah of hosts: take heed then to your spirit, that ye deal not unfaithfully.
<DT><A NAME="2:17">2:17</A><DD>Ye have wearied Jehovah with your words, and ye say, Wherein have we wearied <I>him</I>? In that ye say, Every one that doeth evil is good in the sight of Jehovah, and he delighteth in them; or, Where is the God of judgment?
</DL></DIV><H2>Chapter 3</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="3:1">3:1</A><DD>Behold, I send my <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mal?n=3:1">messenger</A>, and he shall prepare the way before me; and the Lord whom ye seek will suddenly come to his temple, and the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mal?n=3:1">Angel</A> of the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mal?n=3:1a">covenant</A>, whom ye delight in: behold, he cometh, saith Jehovah of hosts.
<DT><A NAME="3:2">3:2</A><DD>But who shall <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mal?n=3:2">endure</A> the day of his coming? and who shall stand when he appeareth? For he will be like a refiner's fire, and like fullers' lye.
<DT><A NAME="3:3">3:3</A><DD>And he shall sit <I>as</I> a refiner and purifier of silver; and he will purify the children of Levi, and purge them as gold and silver; and they shall offer unto Jehovah an oblation in righteousness.
<DT><A NAME="3:4">3:4</A><DD>Then shall the oblation of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant unto Jehovah, as in the days of old, and as in former years.
<DT><A NAME="3:5">3:5</A><DD>And I will come near to you to judgment; and I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers, and against the adulterers, and against the false swearers, and against those that <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mal?n=3:5">oppress</A> the hired servant in <I>his</I> wages, the widow and the fatherless, and that turn aside the stranger <I>from his <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mal?n=3:5a">right</A>,</I> and fear not me, saith Jehovah of hosts.
<DT><A NAME="3:6">3:6</A><DD>For I Jehovah change not, and ye, sons of Jacob, are not consumed.
<DT><A NAME="3:7">3:7</A><DD>Since the days of your fathers have ye departed from my statutes, and have not kept them. Return unto me, and I will return unto you, saith Jehovah of hosts. But ye say, Wherein shall we return?
<DT><A NAME="3:8">3:8</A><DD>Will a man rob God? But ye rob me. And ye say, Wherein do we rob thee? <I>In</I> tithes and heave-offerings.
<DT><A NAME="3:9">3:9</A><DD>Ye are cursed with a curse; and me ye rob, <I>even</I> this whole nation.
<DT><A NAME="3:10">3:10</A><DD>Bring the whole tithe into the treasure-house, that there may be food in my house, and prove me now herewith, saith Jehovah of hosts, if I open not to you the windows of the heavens, and pour you out a blessing, till there be no place for <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mal?n=3:10">it</A>.
<DT><A NAME="3:11">3:11</A><DD>And I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground; neither shall your vine cast its fruit before the time in the field, saith Jehovah of hosts.
<DT><A NAME="3:12">3:12</A><DD>And all nations shall call you blessed; for ye shall be a delightsome land, saith Jehovah of hosts.
<DT><A NAME="3:13">3:13</A><DD>Your words have been stout against me, saith Jehovah; but ye say, What have we been speaking against thee?
<DT><A NAME="3:14">3:14</A><DD>Ye say, It is vain to serve God; and what profit is it that we keep his charge, and that we walk mournfully before Jehovah of hosts?
<DT><A NAME="3:15">3:15</A><DD>And now we hold the proud for happy; yea, they that work wickedness are built up; yea, they tempt God, and they escape.
<DT><A NAME="3:16">3:16</A><DD>Then they that feared Jehovah spoke often one to another; and Jehovah observed <I>it</I>, and heard, and a book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared Jehovah, and that thought upon his name.
<DT><A NAME="3:17">3:17</A><DD>And they shall be unto me a peculiar <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mal?n=3:17">treasure</A>, saith Jehovah of hosts, in the day that I prepare; and I will spare them as a man spareth his own son that serveth him.
<DT><A NAME="3:18">3:18</A><DD>And ye shall return and <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mal?n=3:18">discern</A> between the righteous and the wicked, between him that serveth God and him that serveth him not.
</DL></DIV><H2>Chapter 4</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="4:1">4:1</A><DD>For behold, the day cometh, burning as a furnace; and all the proud and all that work wickedness shall be stubble; and the day that cometh shall burn them up, saith Jehovah of hosts, so that it shall leave them neither root nor branch.
<DT><A NAME="4:2">4:2</A><DD>And unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of righteousness arise with healing in his wings; and ye shall go forth and leap like fatted calves.
<DT><A NAME="4:3">4:3</A><DD>And ye shall tread down the wicked; for they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet in the day that I prepare, saith Jehovah of hosts.
<DT><A NAME="4:4">4:4</A><DD>Remember the law of Moses my servant, which I commanded unto him in Horeb for all Israel, the statutes and ordinances.
<DT><A NAME="4:5">4:5</A><DD>Behold, I send unto you Elijah the prophet, before the coming of the great and terrible day of Jehovah.
<DT><A NAME="4:6">4:6</A><DD>And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers, lest I come and smite the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mal?n=4:6">earth</A> with a <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mal?n=4:6a">curse</A>.
