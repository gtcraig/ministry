<DT><A NAME="1:1">1:1</A><DD>God having spoken in many parts and in many ways <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_heb?n=1:1">formerly</A> to the fathers in the prophets,
<DT><A NAME="1:2">1:2</A><DD>at the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_heb?n=1:2">end</A> of these days has spoken to us in <I>the person of <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_heb?n=1:2a">the</A></I> Son, whom he has established heir of all things, by whom also he made the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_heb?n=1:2b">worlds</A>;
<DT><A NAME="1:3">1:3</A><DD>who being <I>the</I> <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_heb?n=1:3">effulgence</A> of his glory and <I>the</I> expression of his <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_heb?n=1:3a">substance</A>, and upholding all things by the word of <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_heb?n=1:3b">his</A> power, having <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_heb?n=1:3c">made</A> <I>by himself</I> the purification of sins, set himself down on the right hand of the greatness on high,
<DT><A NAME="1:4">1:4</A><DD>taking a place by so much better than the angels, as he inherits a name more excellent than they.
<DT><A NAME="1:5">1:5</A><DD>For to which of the angels said he ever, *Thou* art my Son: this day have *I* begotten <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_heb?n=1:5">thee</A>? and again, *I* will be to him for father, and *he* shall be to me for <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_heb?n=1:5a">son</A>?
<DT><A NAME="1:6">1:6</A><DD>and again, when he <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_heb?n=1:6">brings</A> in the firstborn into the habitable world, he says, And let all God's angels worship <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_heb?n=1:6a">him</A>.
<DT><A NAME="1:7">1:7</A><DD>And as to the angels he says, Who makes his angels spirits and his <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_heb?n=1:7">ministers</A> a flame of <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_heb?n=1:7a">fire</A>;
<DT><A NAME="1:8">1:8</A><DD>but as to the Son, Thy throne, O God, <I>is</I> to the age of the age, and a sceptre of uprightness <I>is</I> the sceptre of thy kingdom.
<DT><A NAME="1:9">1:9</A><DD>Thou hast loved righteousness and hast hated lawlessness; therefore God, thy God, has anointed thee with oil of gladness above thy <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_heb?n=1:9">companions</A>.
<DT><A NAME="1:10">1:10</A><DD>And, *Thou* in the beginning, Lord, hast founded the earth, and works of thy hands are the heavens.
<DT><A NAME="1:11">1:11</A><DD>They shall perish, but *thou* continuest still; and they all shall grow old as a garment,
<DT><A NAME="1:12">1:12</A><DD>and as a covering shalt thou roll them up, and they shall be changed; but *thou* art the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_heb?n=1:12">Same</A>, and thy years shall not <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_heb?n=1:12a">fail</A>.
<DT><A NAME="1:13">1:13</A><DD>But as to which of the angels said he ever, Sit at my right hand until I put thine enemies <I>as</I> footstool of thy <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_heb?n=1:13">feet</A>?
<DT><A NAME="1:14">1:14</A><DD>Are they not all ministering spirits, sent out for service on account of those who shall inherit salvation?
</DL></DIV><H2>Chapter 2</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="2:1">2:1</A><DD>For this reason we should give heed more abundantly to the things <I>we have</I> heard, lest in any way we should slip away.
<DT><A NAME="2:2">2:2</A><DD>For if the word which was spoken by angels <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_heb?n=2:2">was</A> firm, and every transgression and disobedience received just retribution,
<DT><A NAME="2:3">2:3</A><DD>how shall *we* escape if we have been negligent <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_heb?n=2:3">of</A> so great salvation, which, having had its commencement in being spoken <I>of</I> by the Lord, has been confirmed to us by those who have heard;
<DT><A NAME="2:4">2:4</A><DD>God bearing, besides, witness with <I>them</I> to <I>it</I>, both by signs and wonders, and various acts of power, and distributions of <I>the</I> Holy Spirit, according to his will?
<DT><A NAME="2:5">2:5</A><DD>For he has not subjected to angels the habitable world which is to <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_heb?n=2:5">come</A>, of which we speak;
<DT><A NAME="2:6">2:6</A><DD>but one has testified somewhere, <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_heb?n=2:6">saying</A>, What is man, that thou <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_heb?n=2:6a">rememberest</A> him, or son of man that thou visitest him?
<DT><A NAME="2:7">2:7</A><DD>Thou hast made him some little inferior to the angels; thou hast crowned him with glory and honour, <I>and hast set him over the works of thy hands;</I>
<DT><A NAME="2:8">2:8</A><DD>thou hast subjected all things under his feet. For in subjecting all things to him, he has left nothing unsubject to him. But now we see not yet all things subjected to *him*,
<DT><A NAME="2:9">2:9</A><DD>but we see Jesus, who <I>was</I> made some little inferior to <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_heb?n=2:9">angels</A> on account of the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour; so <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_heb?n=2:9a">that</A> by the grace of God he should taste death for every <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_heb?n=2:9b">thing</A>.
<DT><A NAME="2:10">2:10</A><DD>For it became him, for whom <I>are</I> all things, and by whom <I>are</I> all things, in bringing many sons to glory, to make <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_heb?n=2:10">perfect</A> the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_heb?n=2:10a">leader</A> of their salvation through sufferings.
<DT><A NAME="2:11">2:11</A><DD>For both he that sanctifies and those <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_heb?n=2:11">sanctified</A> <I>are</I> all of one; for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren,
<DT><A NAME="2:12">2:12</A><DD><A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_heb?n=2:12">saying</A>, I will declare thy name to my brethren; in <I>the</I> midst of <I>the</I> assembly will I sing thy <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_heb?n=2:12a">praises</A>.
<DT><A NAME="2:13">2:13</A><DD>And again, I will trust in <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_heb?n=2:13">him</A>. And again, Behold, I and the children which God has given <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_heb?n=2:13a">me</A>.
<DT><A NAME="2:14">2:14</A><DD>Since therefore the children <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_heb?n=2:14">partake</A> of blood and flesh, he also, in like <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_heb?n=2:14a">manner</A>, took part <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_heb?n=2:14b">in</A> the same, that through death he might annul him who <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_heb?n=2:14c">has</A> the might of death, that is, the devil;
<DT><A NAME="2:15">2:15</A><DD>and might set free all those who through fear of death through the whole of their life were subject to bondage.
<DT><A NAME="2:16">2:16</A><DD>For he does not indeed take hold of angels <I>by the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_heb?n=2:16">hand</A>,</I> but he takes hold of the seed of Abraham.
<DT><A NAME="2:17">2:17</A><DD>Wherefore it behoved <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_heb?n=2:17">him</A> in all things to be made like to <I>his</I> brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things relating to God, to make propitiation for the sins of the people;
<DT><A NAME="2:18">2:18</A><DD>for, in that himself has suffered, being tempted, he is able to help those that are being tempted.
</DL></DIV><H2>Chapter 3</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="3:1">3:1</A><DD>Wherefore, holy brethren, <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_heb?n=3:1">partakers</A> of <I>the</I> heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our confession, Jesus,
<DT><A NAME="3:2">3:2</A><DD>who is faithful to him that has constituted him, as Moses also in all his <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_heb?n=3:2">house</A>.
<DT><A NAME="3:3">3:3</A><DD>For *he* has been counted worthy of greater glory than Moses, by how much he that has built it has more honour than the house.
<DT><A NAME="3:4">3:4</A><DD>For every house is built by some one; but he who has built all things <I>is</I> God.
<DT><A NAME="3:5">3:5</A><DD>And Moses indeed <I>was</I> faithful in all <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_heb?n=3:5">his</A> house, as a ministering servant, for a testimony of the things to be spoken after;
<DT><A NAME="3:6">3:6</A><DD>but Christ, as Son over <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_heb?n=3:5">his</A> house, whose house are *we*, if indeed we hold fast the boldness and the boast of hope firm to the end.
<DT><A NAME="3:7">3:7</A><DD>Wherefore, even as says the Holy <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_heb?n=3:7">Spirit</A>, To-day if ye will hear his voice,
<DT><A NAME="3:8">3:8</A><DD>harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of temptation in the wilderness;
<DT><A NAME="3:9">3:9</A><DD><A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_heb?n=3:9">where</A> your fathers tempted <I>me</I>, by proving <I>me</I>, and saw my works forty years.
<DT><A NAME="3:10">3:10</A><DD>Wherefore I was wroth with this generation, and said, They always err in heart; and *they* have not known my ways;
<DT><A NAME="3:11">3:11</A><DD>so I swore in my wrath, If they shall enter into my <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_heb?n=3:11">rest</A>.
<DT><A NAME="3:12">3:12</A><DD>See, brethren, lest there be in any one of you a wicked heart of unbelief, in turning away from <I>the</I> living God.
<DT><A NAME="3:13">3:13</A><DD>But encourage yourselves each day, as long as it is called To-day, that none of you be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.
<DT><A NAME="3:14">3:14</A><DD>For we are become <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_heb?n=3:14">companions</A> of the Christ if indeed we hold the beginning of the assurance firm to the end;
<DT><A NAME="3:15">3:15</A><DD>in that it is said, To-day if ye will hear his voice, do not harden your hearts, as in the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_heb?n=3:15">provocation</A>;
<DT><A NAME="3:16">3:16</A><DD>(for who was it, who, having heard, provoked? but <I>was it</I> <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_heb?n=3:16">not</A> all who came out of Egypt by Moses?
<DT><A NAME="3:17">3:17</A><DD>And with whom was he wroth forty years? <I>Was it</I> not with those who had sinned, whose <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_heb?n=3:17">carcases</A> fell in the wilderness?
<DT><A NAME="3:18">3:18</A><DD>And to whom sware he that they should not enter into his rest, but to those who had not hearkened to the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_heb?n=3:18">word</A>?
<DT><A NAME="3:19">3:19</A><DD>And we see that they could not enter in on account of unbelief;)
</DL></DIV><H2>Chapter 4</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="4:1">4:1</A><DD>Let us therefore fear, lest, a promise being left of entering into his rest, any one of you might seem to have failed <I>of it</I>.
<DT><A NAME="4:2">4:2</A><DD>For indeed we have had glad tidings presented to us, even as they also; but the word of the report did not profit *them*, not being mixed with faith in those who heard.
<DT><A NAME="4:3">4:3</A><DD>For we enter into the rest who have believed; as he said, As I have sworn in my wrath, If they shall enter into my rest; although the works had been completed from <I>the</I> foundation of <I>the</I> world.
<DT><A NAME="4:4">4:4</A><DD>For he has said somewhere of the seventh <I>day</I> thus, And God rested on the seventh day from all his <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_heb?n=4:4">works</A>:
<DT><A NAME="4:5">4:5</A><DD>and in this again, If they shall enter into my rest.
<DT><A NAME="4:6">4:6</A><DD>Seeing therefore it remains that some enter into it, and those who first received the glad tidings did not enter in on account of not hearkening to the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_heb?n=3:18">word</A>,
<DT><A NAME="4:7">4:7</A><DD>again he determines a certain day, saying, in David, 'To-day,' after so long a time; (according as it has been said before), To-day, if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts.
<DT><A NAME="4:8">4:8</A><DD>For if <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_heb?n=4:8">Jesus</A> had brought them into rest, he would not have spoken afterwards about another day.
<DT><A NAME="4:9">4:9</A><DD>There remains then a sabbatism to the people of God.
<DT><A NAME="4:10">4:10</A><DD>For he that has entered into his rest, he also has rested from his works, as God did from his own.
<DT><A NAME="4:11">4:11</A><DD>Let us therefore use <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_heb?n=4:11">diligence</A> to <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_heb?n=4:11">enter</A> into that rest, that no one may fall after the same example of not hearkening to the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_heb?n=4:11a">word</A>.
<DT><A NAME="4:12">4:12</A><DD>For the word of God <I>is</I> living and operative, and sharper than any two-edged sword, and penetrating to <I>the</I> <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_heb?n=4:12">division</A> of soul and spirit, both of joints and marrow, and a discerner of the thoughts and intents of <I>the</I> heart.
<DT><A NAME="4:13">4:13</A><DD>And there is not a creature unapparent before him; but all things <I>are</I> naked and laid bare to his eyes, with whom we have to do.
<DT><A NAME="4:14">4:14</A><DD>Having therefore a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast the confession.
<DT><A NAME="4:15">4:15</A><DD>For we have not a high priest not able to sympathise with our infirmities, but tempted in all things in like <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_heb?n=4:15">manner</A>, sin apart.
<DT><A NAME="4:16">4:16</A><DD>Let us approach therefore with boldness to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy, and find grace for seasonable help.
</DL></DIV><H2>Chapter 5</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="5:1">5:1</A><DD>For every high priest taken from amongst men is established for men in things relating to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins;
<DT><A NAME="5:2">5:2</A><DD>being able to exercise forbearance towards the ignorant and erring, since he himself also is clothed with infirmity;
<DT><A NAME="5:3">5:3</A><DD>and, on account of this <I>infirmity</I>, he ought, even as for the people, so also for himself, to offer for sins.
<DT><A NAME="5:4">5:4</A><DD>And no one takes the honour to himself but <I>as</I> called by God, even as Aaron also.
<DT><A NAME="5:5">5:5</A><DD>Thus the Christ also has not glorified himself to be made a high priest; but he who had said to him, *Thou* art my Son, *I* have to-day begotten <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_heb?n=5:5">thee</A>.
<DT><A NAME="5:6">5:6</A><DD>Even as also in another <I>place</I> he says, *Thou* <I>art</I> a priest for <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_heb?n=5:6">ever</A> according to the order of <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_heb?n=5:6a">Melchisedec</A>.
<DT><A NAME="5:7">5:7</A><DD>Who in the days of his flesh, having offered up both supplications and entreaties to him who was able to save him out <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_heb?n=5:7">of</A> death, with strong crying and tears; (and having been heard because of his <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_heb?n=5:7a">piety</A>;)
<DT><A NAME="5:8">5:8</A><DD>though he were <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_heb?n=5:8">Son</A>, he learned obedience from the things which he suffered;
<DT><A NAME="5:9">5:9</A><DD>and having been perfected, became to all them that obey him, <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_heb?n=5:9">author</A> of eternal salvation;
<DT><A NAME="5:10">5:10</A><DD>addressed <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_heb?n=5:10">by</A> God <I>as</I> high priest according to the order of Melchisedec.
<DT><A NAME="5:11">5:11</A><DD>Concerning whom we have much to say, and hard to be interpreted in speaking <I>of it</I>, since ye are become dull in hearing.
<DT><A NAME="5:12">5:12</A><DD>For when for the time ye ought to be teachers, ye have again need that <I>one</I> should teach you what <I>are</I> the elements of the beginning of the oracles of God, and are become such as have need of milk, <I>and</I> not of solid food.
<DT><A NAME="5:13">5:13</A><DD>For every one that <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_heb?n=5:13">partakes</A> of milk <I>is</I> unskilled in the word of righteousness, for he is a babe;
<DT><A NAME="5:14">5:14</A><DD>but solid food belongs to full-grown men, who, on account of habit, have their senses exercised for distinguishing both good and evil.
</DL></DIV><H2>Chapter 6</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="6:1">6:1</A><DD>Wherefore, leaving the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_heb?n=6:1">word</A> of the beginning of the Christ, let us go on <I>to what belongs</I> to full <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_heb?n=6:1a">growth</A>, not laying again a foundation of repentance from dead works and faith <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_heb?n=6:1b">in</A> God,
<DT><A NAME="6:2">6:2</A><DD>of <I>the</I> doctrine of washings, and of imposition of hands, and of resurrection of <I>the</I> dead, and of eternal judgment;
<DT><A NAME="6:3">6:3</A><DD>and this will we do if God permit.
<DT><A NAME="6:4">6:4</A><DD>For it is impossible to <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_heb?n=6:4">renew</A> again to repentance those once enlightened, and who have tasted of the heavenly gift, and have been made <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_heb?n=5:13">partakers</A> of <I>the</I> Holy Spirit,
<DT><A NAME="6:5">6:5</A><DD>and have tasted the good word of God, and <I>the</I> works of power of <I>the</I> age to come,

</DL></DIV><H2>Chapter 7</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="7:1">7:1</A><DD>For this Melchisedec, King of Salem, priest of the most <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_heb?n=7:1">high</A> God, who met Abraham returning from smiting the kings, and blessed him;
<DT><A NAME="7:2">7:2</A><DD>to whom Abraham gave also the tenth portion of all; first being interpreted King of righteousness, and then also King of Salem, which is King of peace;
<DT><A NAME="7:3">7:3</A><DD>without father, without mother, without genealogy; having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_heb?n=7:3">assimilated</A> to the Son of God, abides a priest <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_heb?n=7:3a">continually</A>.
<DT><A NAME="7:4">7:4</A><DD>Now consider how great this <I>personage</I> was, to whom <I>even</I> the patriarch Abraham gave a tenth out of the spoils.
<DT><A NAME="7:5">7:5</A><DD>And they indeed from among the sons of Levi, who receive the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_heb?n=7:5">priesthood</A>, have commandment to take tithes from the people according to the law, that is from their brethren, though these are come out of the loins of Abraham:
<DT><A NAME="7:6">7:6</A><DD>but he who has no <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_heb?n=7:6">genealogy</A> from them has tithed Abraham, and blessed him who had the promises.
<DT><A NAME="7:7">7:7</A><DD>But beyond all gainsaying, the inferior is blessed by the better.
<DT><A NAME="7:8">7:8</A><DD>And here dying men receive tithes; but there <I>one</I> of whom the witness is that he lives;
<DT><A NAME="7:9">7:9</A><DD>and, so to speak, through Abraham, Levi also, who received tithes, has been made to pay tithes.
<DT><A NAME="7:10">7:10</A><DD>For he was yet in the loins of his father when Melchisedec met him.
<DT><A NAME="7:11">7:11</A><DD>If indeed then perfection were by the Levitical priesthood, for the people had their law given to them in connexion with <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_heb?n=7:11">*it*</A>, what need <I>was there</I> still that a different priest should arise according to the order of Melchisedec, and not be named after the order of Aaron?
<DT><A NAME="7:12">7:12</A><DD>For, the priesthood being changed, there takes place of necessity a change of law also.
<DT><A NAME="7:13">7:13</A><DD>For he, of whom these things are said, belongs <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_heb?n=7:13">to</A> a different tribe, of which no one has <I>ever</I> been attached <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_heb?n=7:13a">to</A> the service of the altar.
<DT><A NAME="7:14">7:14</A><DD>For it is clear that our Lord has <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_heb?n=7:14">sprung</A> out of Juda, as to which tribe Moses spake nothing as to priests.
<DT><A NAME="7:15">7:15</A><DD>And it is yet more abundantly evident, since a different priest arises according to the similitude of Melchisedec,
<DT><A NAME="7:16">7:16</A><DD>who has been constituted not according to law of fleshly commandment, but according to power of indissoluble life.
<DT><A NAME="7:17">7:17</A><DD>For it is borne <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_heb?n=7:17">witness</A>, *Thou* art a priest for <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_heb?n=7:17a">ever</A> according to the order of Melchisedec.
<DT><A NAME="7:18">7:18</A><DD>For there is a setting aside of the commandment going before for its weakness and unprofitableness,
<DT><A NAME="7:19">7:19</A><DD>(for the law perfected nothing,) and the introduction of a better hope by which we draw nigh to God.
<DT><A NAME="7:20">7:20</A><DD>And by how much <I>it was</I> not without the swearing of an oath;
<DT><A NAME="7:21">7:21</A><DD>(for they are become priests without the swearing of an oath, but he with the swearing of an oath, by him who said, as to <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_heb?n=7:21">him</A>, The Lord has sworn, and will not repent <I>of it</I>, *Thou* <I>art</I> priest for ever <I>according to the order of Melchisedec</I>;)
<DT><A NAME="7:22">7:22</A><DD>by so much Jesus became surety of a better covenant.
<DT><A NAME="7:23">7:23</A><DD>And they have been many priests, on account of being hindered from continuing by death;

<DT><A NAME="7:25">7:25</A><DD>Whence also he is able to save completely those who approach by him to God, always living to intercede for them.
<DT><A NAME="7:26">7:26</A><DD>For such a high priest became us, <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_heb?n=7:26">holy</A>, <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_heb?n=7:26a">harmless</A>, undefiled, separated from sinners, and become higher than the heavens:
