<DT><A NAME="1:1">1:1</A><DD>And it came to pass after the death of Moses the servant of Jehovah, that Jehovah spoke to <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_jos?n=1:1">Joshua</A> the son of Nun, Moses' attendant, saying,
<DT><A NAME="1:2">1:2</A><DD>Moses my servant is dead; and now, rise up, go over this Jordan, thou and all this people, into the land which I give unto them, to the children of Israel.
<DT><A NAME="1:3">1:3</A><DD>Every place whereon the sole of your foot shall tread have I given to you, as I said unto Moses.
<DT><A NAME="1:4">1:4</A><DD>From the wilderness and this Lebanon to the great river, the river Euphrates, the whole land of the Hittites, to the great sea, toward the going down of the sun, shall be your border.
<DT><A NAME="1:5">1:5</A><DD>None shall be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life: as I was with Moses, so will I be with thee; I will not leave thee, neither will I forsake thee.
<DT><A NAME="1:6">1:6</A><DD>Be strong and courageous, for thou shalt cause this people to inherit the land which I have sworn unto their fathers to give them.
<DT><A NAME="1:7">1:7</A><DD>Only be strong and very courageous, that thou mayest take heed to do according to all the law that Moses my servant commanded thee. Turn not from it to the right or to the left, that thou mayest prosper whithersoever thou goest.
<DT><A NAME="1:8">1:8</A><DD>This book of the law shall not depart from thy mouth; and thou shalt meditate upon it day and night, that thou mayest take heed to do according to all that is written therein; for then shalt thou have good success in thy ways, and then shalt thou prosper.
<DT><A NAME="1:9">1:9</A><DD>Have I not commanded thee: Be strong and courageous? Be not afraid, neither be dismayed; for Jehovah thy God is with thee whithersoever thou goest.
<DT><A NAME="1:10">1:10</A><DD>And Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying,
<DT><A NAME="1:11">1:11</A><DD>Go through the midst of the camp, and command the people, saying, Prepare yourselves <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_jos?n=1:11">victuals</A>, for in three days ye shall pass over this Jordan, that ye may enter in to take possession of the land which Jehovah your God giveth you to possess it.
<DT><A NAME="1:12">1:12</A><DD>And to the Reubenites and to the Gadites and to half the tribe of Manasseh spoke Joshua, saying,
<DT><A NAME="1:13">1:13</A><DD>Remember the word that Moses the servant of Jehovah commanded you, saying, Jehovah your God has given you rest and has given you this land.
<DT><A NAME="1:14">1:14</A><DD>Your wives, your little ones, and your cattle shall abide in the land that Moses gave you on this side of the Jordan, but ye, all the valiant men, shall go over in <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_jos?n=1:14">array</A> before your brethren and help them,
<DT><A NAME="1:15">1:15</A><DD>until Jehovah give your brethren rest as to you, and they also take possession of the land which Jehovah your God giveth them; then shall ye return into the land of your possession and possess it, which Moses the servant of Jehovah gave you on this side of the Jordan toward the sun-rising.
<DT><A NAME="1:16">1:16</A><DD>And they answered Joshua, saying, All that thou hast commanded us will we do, and whither thou shalt send us will we go.
<DT><A NAME="1:17">1:17</A><DD>According as we hearkened to Moses in all things, so will we hearken to thee; only may Jehovah thy God be with thee as he was with Moses.
<DT><A NAME="1:18">1:18</A><DD>Every one that is rebellious against thy <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_jos?n=1:18">commandment</A> and hearkeneth not to thy words in everything that thou commandest <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_jos?n=1:18a">us</A>, shall be put to death. Only be strong and courageous.

<DT><A NAME="2:1">2:1</A><DD>And Joshua the son of Nun sent from Shittim two spies secretly, saying, Go, see the land, even Jericho. And they went, and came into a <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_jos?n=2:1">harlot's</A> house, named Rahab, and they lay down there.
<DT><A NAME="2:2">2:2</A><DD>And it was told the king of Jericho, saying, Behold, men have come hither to-night from the children of Israel to search out the land.
<DT><A NAME="2:3">2:3</A><DD>And the king of Jericho sent to Rahab, saying, Bring forth the men that have come to thee, who have come into thy house: for they have come to search out all the land.
<DT><A NAME="2:4">2:4</A><DD>And the woman had taken and concealed the two men; and she said, Yes, the men did come unto me, but I knew not whence they were;
<DT><A NAME="2:5">2:5</A><DD>and it came to pass when the gate had to be closed, at dark, that the men went out: I know not whither the men have gone. Pursue after them quickly; for ye shall overtake them.
<DT><A NAME="2:6">2:6</A><DD>But she had taken them up to the roof, and secreted them under the stalks of flax, which she had laid out on the roof.
<DT><A NAME="2:7">2:7</A><DD>And the men pursued after them the way to the Jordan, to the fords; and when they who pursued after them had gone out, they closed the gate.
<DT><A NAME="2:8">2:8</A><DD>And before they had lain down, she went up to them upon the roof;
<DT><A NAME="2:9">2:9</A><DD>and said to the men, I know that Jehovah has given you the land, and that the dread of you has fallen on us, and that all the inhabitants of the land <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_jos?n=2:9">faint</A> because of you.
<DT><A NAME="2:10">2:10</A><DD>For we have heard that Jehovah dried up the waters of the Red sea before you when ye came out of Egypt; and what ye did to the two kings of the Amorites that were beyond the Jordan, to Sihon and to Og, whom ye utterly <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_jos?n=2:10">destroyed</A>.
<DT><A NAME="2:11">2:11</A><DD>We heard <I>of it</I>, and our heart melted, and there remained no more spirit in any man because of you; for Jehovah your God, he is God in the heavens above and on the earth beneath.
<DT><A NAME="2:12">2:12</A><DD>And now, I pray you, swear to me by Jehovah, since I have dealt kindly with you, that ye will also deal kindly with my father's house, and give me a certain <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_jos?n=2:12">sign</A>,
<DT><A NAME="2:13">2:13</A><DD>that ye will let my father live, and my mother, and my brethren, and my sisters, and all that belong to them, and deliver our souls from death.
<DT><A NAME="2:14">2:14</A><DD>And the men said to her, Our lives shall pay for yours, if ye do not make this our business known; and it shall be when Jehovah shall give us the land, that we will deal kindly and truly with thee.
<DT><A NAME="2:15">2:15</A><DD>And she let them down by a cord through the window; for her house was upon the city-wall, and she dwelt upon the wall.
<DT><A NAME="2:16">2:16</A><DD>And she said to them, Go to the mountain, that the pursuers may not meet with you; and hide yourselves there three days, until the pursuers have returned; and afterwards go your way.
<DT><A NAME="2:17">2:17</A><DD>And the men said to her, We will be quit of this thine oath which thou hast made us swear.
<DT><A NAME="2:18">2:18</A><DD>Behold, when we come into the land, thou shalt bind in the window this line of scarlet thread by which thou hast let us down; and thou shalt gather to thee in the house thy father, and thy mother, and thy brethren, and all thy father's household;
<DT><A NAME="2:19">2:19</A><DD>and it shall be, that whoever shall go out of the doors of thy house into the street, -- his blood shall be upon his head, and we shall be innocent; but every one who shall be with thee in the house, his blood shall be upon our head, if any hand be upon him.
<DT><A NAME="2:20">2:20</A><DD>And if thou make known this our business, we will be quit of thine oath which thou hast made us swear.
<DT><A NAME="2:21">2:21</A><DD>And she said, According to your words, so be it. And she sent them away, and they departed. And she bound the scarlet line in the window.
<DT><A NAME="2:22">2:22</A><DD>And they went, and came to the mountain, and remained there three days, until the pursuers had returned; and the pursuers sought them all the way, and found them not.
<DT><A NAME="2:23">2:23</A><DD>And the two men returned and came down from the mountain, and went over and came to Joshua the son of Nun, and related to him everything that had happened to them.
<DT><A NAME="2:24">2:24</A><DD>And they said to Joshua, Of a surety Jehovah has given the whole land into our hands, and even all the inhabitants of the land faint because of us.

<DT><A NAME="3:1">3:1</A><DD>And Joshua rose early in the morning; and they removed from Shittim, and came to the Jordan, he and all the children of Israel, and lodged there before they passed over.
<DT><A NAME="3:2">3:2</A><DD>And it came to pass at the end of three days, that the officers went through the camp;
<DT><A NAME="3:3">3:3</A><DD>and they commanded the people, saying, When ye see the ark of the covenant of Jehovah your God, and the priests the Levites bearing it, then remove from your place, and go after it;
<DT><A NAME="3:4">3:4</A><DD>yet there shall be a distance between you and it, about two thousand cubits by measure. Ye shall not come near it, that ye may know the way by which ye must go; for ye have not passed this way heretofore.
<DT><A NAME="3:5">3:5</A><DD>And Joshua said to the people, Hallow yourselves; for to-morrow Jehovah will do wonders in your midst.
<DT><A NAME="3:6">3:6</A><DD>And Joshua spoke to the priests, saying, Take up the ark of the covenant, and go over before the people. And they took up the ark of the covenant, and went before the people.
<DT><A NAME="3:7">3:7</A><DD>And Jehovah said to Joshua, This day will I begin to magnify thee in the sight of all Israel, that they may know that as I was with Moses, so will I be with thee.
<DT><A NAME="3:8">3:8</A><DD>And thou shalt command the priests who bear the ark of the covenant, saying, When ye come to the edge of the waters of the Jordan, stand still in the Jordan.
<DT><A NAME="3:9">3:9</A><DD>And Joshua said to the children of Israel, Come hither, and hear the words of Jehovah your God.
<DT><A NAME="3:10">3:10</A><DD>And Joshua said, Hereby shall ye know that <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_jos?n=3:10">the</A> living ùGod is in your midst, and <I>that</I> he will without fail dispossess from before you the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Hivites, and the Perizzites, and the Girgashites, and the Amorites, and the Jebusites.
<DT><A NAME="3:11">3:11</A><DD>Behold, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth is going over before you into the Jordan.
<DT><A NAME="3:12">3:12</A><DD>And now take you twelve men out of the tribes of Israel, one man for each tribe.
<DT><A NAME="3:13">3:13</A><DD>And it shall come to pass, when the soles of the feet of the priests who bear the ark of Jehovah, the Lord of all the earth, rest in the waters of the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan, the waters flowing down from above, shall be cut off, and shall stand up in a heap.
<DT><A NAME="3:14">3:14</A><DD>And it came to pass when the people removed from their tents, to pass over the Jordan, that the priests bearing the ark of the covenant were before the people;
<DT><A NAME="3:15">3:15</A><DD>and when they that bore the ark were come to the Jordan, and the feet of the priests who bore the ark dipped in the edge of the water (and the Jordan is full over all its banks throughout the days of harvest),
<DT><A NAME="3:16">3:16</A><DD>the waters which flowed down from above stood <I>and</I> rose up in a heap, very far, by Adam, the city that is beside Zaretan; and those that flowed down towards the sea of the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_jos?n=3:16">plain</A>, the salt sea, were completely cut off. And the people went over opposite to Jericho.
<DT><A NAME="3:17">3:17</A><DD>And the priests who bore the ark of the covenant of Jehovah stood firm on dry ground in the midst of the Jordan. And all Israel went over on dry ground, until all the nation had completely gone over the Jordan.
</DL></DIV><H2>Chapter 4</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="4:1">4:1</A><DD>And it came to pass when the whole nation had completely gone over the Jordan, that Jehovah spoke to Joshua, saying,
<DT><A NAME="4:2">4:2</A><DD>Take you twelve men out of the people, one man out of every tribe,
<DT><A NAME="4:3">4:3</A><DD>and command them, saying, Take up hence out of the midst of the Jordan, from the place where the priests' feet stood firm, twelve stones, and carry them over with you, and lay them down in the lodging-place where ye shall lodge this night.
<DT><A NAME="4:4">4:4</A><DD>And Joshua called the twelve men, whom he had appointed of the children of Israel, a man out of every tribe;
<DT><A NAME="4:5">4:5</A><DD>and Joshua said to them, Pass before the ark of Jehovah your God into the midst of the Jordan, and lift up each of you a stone <I>and put it</I> upon his shoulder, according to the number of the tribes of the children of Israel,
<DT><A NAME="4:6">4:6</A><DD>that this may be a sign in your midst. When your children ask <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_jos?n=4:6">hereafter</A>, saying, What mean ye by these stones?
<DT><A NAME="4:7">4:7</A><DD>then ye shall say to them, That the waters of the Jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of Jehovah; when it went through the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan were cut off. And these stones shall be for a memorial unto the children of Israel for ever.
<DT><A NAME="4:8">4:8</A><DD>And the children of Israel did so, as Joshua had commanded, and took up twelve stones out of the midst of the Jordan, as Jehovah had spoken to Joshua, according to the number of the tribes of the children of Israel; and they carried them over with them to the lodging-place, and laid them down there.
<DT><A NAME="4:9">4:9</A><DD>And twelve stones did Joshua set up in the midst of the Jordan, in the place where the feet of the priests who bore the ark of the covenant had stood firm; and they are there to this day.
<DT><A NAME="4:10">4:10</A><DD>And the priests who bore the ark stood in the midst of the Jordan, until everything was finished that Jehovah had commanded Joshua to speak unto the people, according to all that Moses had commanded Joshua. And the people hasted and passed over.
<DT><A NAME="4:11">4:11</A><DD>And it came to pass, when all the people had completely gone over, that the ark of Jehovah went over, and the priests, in the presence of the people.
<DT><A NAME="4:12">4:12</A><DD>And the children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and the half tribe of Manasseh, went over in array before the children of Israel, as Moses had spoken to them.
<DT><A NAME="4:13">4:13</A><DD>About forty thousand armed for military service passed over before Jehovah to the war, unto the plains of Jericho.
<DT><A NAME="4:14">4:14</A><DD>On that day Jehovah magnified Joshua in the sight of all Israel; and they feared him, as they had feared Moses, all the days of his life.
<DT><A NAME="4:15">4:15</A><DD>And Jehovah spoke to Joshua, saying,
<DT><A NAME="4:16">4:16</A><DD>Command the priests who bear the ark of the testimony, that they come up out of the Jordan.
<DT><A NAME="4:17">4:17</A><DD>And Joshua commanded the priests, saying, Come up out of the Jordan.
<DT><A NAME="4:18">4:18</A><DD>And it came to pass when the priests who bore the ark of the covenant of Jehovah had come up out of the midst of the Jordan, <I>when</I> the soles of the priests' feet were lifted up on to the dry land, that the waters of the Jordan returned to their place, and they flowed as <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_jos?n=4:18">previously</A>, over all its banks.
<DT><A NAME="4:19">4:19</A><DD>And the people came up out of the Jordan on the tenth of the first month, and encamped in Gilgal, on the eastern extremity of Jericho.
<DT><A NAME="4:20">4:20</A><DD>And those twelve stones which they had taken out of the Jordan did Joshua set up in Gilgal.
<DT><A NAME="4:21">4:21</A><DD>And he spoke to the children of Israel, saying, When your children hereafter ask their fathers, saying, What <I>mean</I> these stones?
<DT><A NAME="4:22">4:22</A><DD>then ye shall let your children know, saying, On dry land did Israel come over this Jordan;
<DT><A NAME="4:23">4:23</A><DD>because Jehovah your God dried up the waters of the Jordan from before you, until ye had passed over, as Jehovah your God did to the Red sea, which he dried up from before us, until we had passed over;
<DT><A NAME="4:24">4:24</A><DD>that all peoples of the earth might know the hand of Jehovah, that it is mighty; that ye might fear Jehovah your God <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_jos?n=4:24">continually</A>.
</DL></DIV><H2>Chapter 5</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="5:1">5:1</A><DD>And it came to pass when all the kings of the Amorites, who were beyond the Jordan westward, and all the kings of the Canaanites, who were by the sea, heard that Jehovah had dried up the waters of the Jordan from before the children of Israel, until they had passed over, that their heart melted, and there was no spirit in them any more, because of the children of Israel.
<DT><A NAME="5:2">5:2</A><DD>At that time Jehovah said to Joshua, Make thee <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_jos?n=5:2">stone-knives</A>, and circumcise again the children of Israel the second time.
<DT><A NAME="5:3">5:3</A><DD>And Joshua made him <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_jos?n=5:2">stone-knives</A>, and circumcised the children of Israel at the hill of <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_jos?n=5:3">Araloth</A>.
<DT><A NAME="5:4">5:4</A><DD>And this is the cause why Joshua circumcised <I>them</I>: all the people that had come out of Egypt, the males, all the men of war, had died in the wilderness on the way, after they came out of Egypt.
<DT><A NAME="5:5">5:5</A><DD>For all the people that came out were circumcised; but all the people that were born in the wilderness on the way, after they came out of Egypt, <I>them</I> had they not circumcised.
<DT><A NAME="5:6">5:6</A><DD>For the children of Israel had walked forty years in the wilderness, till the whole nation of men of war had perished who had come out of Egypt, who had not hearkened to the voice of Jehovah; to whom Jehovah had sworn that he would not show them the land which Jehovah had sworn unto their fathers that he would give us, a land flowing with milk and honey.
<DT><A NAME="5:7">5:7</A><DD>And their sons <I>whom</I> he raised up in their stead, them Joshua circumcised, for they were uncircumcised, because they had not circumcised them on the way.
<DT><A NAME="5:8">5:8</A><DD>And it came to pass when the whole nation had finished being circumcised, that they abode in their place in the camp, till they were whole.
<DT><A NAME="5:9">5:9</A><DD>And Jehovah said to Joshua, This day have I rolled away the reproach of Egypt from off you. And the name of the place was called <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_jos?n=5:9">Gilgal</A> to this day.
<DT><A NAME="5:10">5:10</A><DD>And the children of Israel encamped in Gilgal, and held the passover on the fourteenth day of the month, at even, in the plains of Jericho.
<DT><A NAME="5:11">5:11</A><DD>And they ate of the old <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_jos?n=5:11">corn</A> of the land on the morrow after the passover, unleavened loaves, and roasted <I>corn</I> on that same day.
<DT><A NAME="5:12">5:12</A><DD>And the manna ceased on the morrow, when they had eaten of the old corn of the land; and there was no more manna for the children of Israel; and they ate of the produce of the land of Canaan that year.

<DT><A NAME="10:2">10:2</A><DD>that they feared greatly; for Gibeon was a great city, as one of the royal cities, and it was greater than Ai, and all its men were mighty.
<DT><A NAME="10:3">10:3</A><DD>And Adoni-zedek king of Jerusalem sent to Hoham king of Hebron, and to Piream king of Jarmuth, and to Japhia king of Lachish, and to Debir king of Eglon, saying,
<DT><A NAME="10:4">10:4</A><DD>Come up to me, and help me, that we may smite Gibeon; for it has made peace with Joshua and with the children of Israel.
<DT><A NAME="10:5">10:5</A><DD>And the five kings of the Amorites, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, <I>and</I> the king of Eglon, gathered themselves together, and went up, they and all their <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_jos?n=10:5">armies</A>, and they encamped before Gibeon, and made war against it.
<DT><A NAME="10:6">10:6</A><DD>And the men of Gibeon sent to Joshua, to the camp at Gilgal, saying, Withdraw not thy hand from thy servants: come up to us quickly, and save us and help us; for all the kings of the Amorites that dwell in the hill-country are gathered against us.
<DT><A NAME="10:7">10:7</A><DD>So Joshua went up from Gilgal, he and all the people of war with him, even all the valiant men.
<DT><A NAME="10:8">10:8</A><DD>And Jehovah said to Joshua, Fear them not; for into thy hand have I given them: not a man of them shall stand before thee.
<DT><A NAME="10:9">10:9</A><DD>And Joshua came upon them suddenly; he went up from Gilgal all night.
<DT><A NAME="10:10">10:10</A><DD>And Jehovah discomfited them before Israel, and smote them <I>with</I> a great slaughter at Gibeon; and he chased them on the way of the ascent of Beth-horon, and smote them up to Azekah and Makkedah.
<DT><A NAME="10:11">10:11</A><DD>And it came to pass, as they fled from before Israel, -- they were at the descent of Beth-horon, -- that Jehovah cast down great stones from heaven upon them up to Azekah, and they died. They were more who died with the hailstones than they whom the children of Israel had slain with the sword.
<DT><A NAME="10:12">10:12</A><DD>Then spoke Joshua to Jehovah in the day when Jehovah gave up the Amorites before the children of Israel, and he said in the sight of Israel, Sun, stand <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_jos?n=10:12">still</A> upon Gibeon; And thou, moon, in the valley of Ajalon!
<DT><A NAME="10:13">10:13</A><DD>And the sun stood still, and the moon remained where it was, until the nation had avenged themselves upon their enemies. Is not this written in the book of <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_jos?n=10:13">Jasher</A>? And the sun remained standing in the midst of heaven, and hasted not to go down about a full day.
<DT><A NAME="10:14">10:14</A><DD>And there was no day like that before it or after it, that Jehovah hearkened to the voice of a man; for Jehovah fought for Israel.
<DT><A NAME="10:15">10:15</A><DD>And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to the camp, to Gilgal.
<DT><A NAME="10:16">10:16</A><DD>And these five kings fled, and hid themselves in the cave at Makkedah.
<DT><A NAME="10:17">10:17</A><DD>And it was told Joshua, saying, The five kings have been found, hid in the cave at Makkedah.
<DT><A NAME="10:18">10:18</A><DD>And Joshua said, Roll great stones before the mouth of the cave, and set men before it to keep them.
<DT><A NAME="10:19">10:19</A><DD>And ye, stay not, pursue after your enemies, and smite the hindmost of them; suffer them not to enter into their cities; for Jehovah your God has given them into your hand.
<DT><A NAME="10:20">10:20</A><DD>And it came to pass when Joshua and the children of Israel had ended smiting them with a very great slaughter, until they were consumed, that the remnant which remained of them entered into fortified cities;
<DT><A NAME="10:21">10:21</A><DD>and all the people returned to the camp to Joshua, at Makkedah, in peace; none moved his tongue against the children of Israel.
<DT><A NAME="10:22">10:22</A><DD>And Joshua said, Open the mouth of the cave, and bring forth to me those five kings out of the cave.
<DT><A NAME="10:23">10:23</A><DD>And they did so, and brought forth to him those five kings out of the cave, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king of Eglon.
<DT><A NAME="10:24">10:24</A><DD>And it came to pass when they had brought forth those kings to Joshua, that Joshua called to all the men of Israel, and said to the captains of the men of war who went with him, Come forward, put your feet on the necks of these kings. And they came forward and put their feet on their necks.
<DT><A NAME="10:25">10:25</A><DD>And Joshua said to them, Fear not, neither be dismayed; be strong and courageous, for thus will Jehovah do to all your enemies against whom ye fight.
<DT><A NAME="10:26">10:26</A><DD>And afterwards Joshua smote them, and put them to death, and hanged them on five trees; and they were hanging upon the trees until the evening.
<DT><A NAME="10:27">10:27</A><DD>And it came to pass at the time of the going down of the sun, that Joshua commanded, and they took them down off the trees, and cast them into the cave where they had been hid, and laid great stones before the cave's mouth, <I>which remain</I> to this very day.
<DT><A NAME="10:28">10:28</A><DD>And Joshua took Makkedah on that day, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and the king thereof, him and all the souls that were therein he utterly destroyed; he let none remain; and he did to the king of Makkedah as he had done to the king of Jericho.
<DT><A NAME="10:29">10:29</A><DD>And Joshua passed, and all Israel with him, from Makkedah to Libnah, and fought against Libnah.
<DT><A NAME="10:30">10:30</A><DD>And Jehovah gave it also and the king thereof into the hand of Israel; and he smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that were therein; he let none remain in it: and he did to the king thereof as he had done to the king of Jericho.
<DT><A NAME="10:31">10:31</A><DD>And Joshua passed, and all Israel with him, from Libnah to Lachish, and encamped against it, and fought against it.
<DT><A NAME="10:32">10:32</A><DD>And Jehovah gave Lachish into the hand of Israel; and they took it on the second day, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that were therein, according to all that he had done to Libnah.
<DT><A NAME="10:33">10:33</A><DD>Then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish; and Joshua smote him and his people, until he had left him none remaining.
<DT><A NAME="10:34">10:34</A><DD>And Joshua, and all Israel with him, passed from Lachish to Eglon; and they encamped against it, and fought against it.
<DT><A NAME="10:35">10:35</A><DD>And they took it on that day, and smote it with the edge of the sword; and all the souls that were therein he utterly destroyed on that day, according to all that he had done to Lachish.
<DT><A NAME="10:36">10:36</A><DD>And Joshua went up, and all Israel with him, from Eglon to Hebron; and they fought against it.
<DT><A NAME="10:37">10:37</A><DD>And they took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and the king thereof, and all the cities thereof, and all the souls that were therein: he let none remain, according to all that he had done to Eglon; and he utterly destroyed it, and all the souls that were therein.
<DT><A NAME="10:38">10:38</A><DD>And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to Debir; and fought against it.
<DT><A NAME="10:39">10:39</A><DD>And he took it, and the king thereof, and all the cities thereof, and they smote them with the edge of the sword, and utterly destroyed all the souls that were therein; he let none remain: as he had done to Hebron, and as he had done to Libnah, and to the king thereof, so he did to Debir and to the king thereof.
<DT><A NAME="10:40">10:40</A><DD>And Joshua smote the whole country, the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_jos?n=10:40">mountain</A>, and the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_jos?n=10:40a">south</A>, and the lowland, and the hill-slopes, and all their kings: he let none remain, but he utterly destroyed all that breathed, as Jehovah the God of Israel had commanded.
<DT><A NAME="10:41">10:41</A><DD>And Joshua smote them from Kadesh-barnea even to Gazah, and all the country of Goshen, even to Gibeon;
<DT><A NAME="10:42">10:42</A><DD>and all these kings and their land did Joshua take at one time; for Jehovah the God of Israel fought for Israel.
<DT><A NAME="10:43">10:43</A><DD>And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to the camp, to Gilgal.

<DT><A NAME="11:1">11:1</A><DD>And it came to pass when Jabin king of Hazor heard <I>this</I>, that he sent to Jobab king of Madon, and to the king of Shimron, and to the king of Achshaph,
<DT><A NAME="11:2">11:2</A><DD>and to the kings that were northward in the mountains, and in the plain south of <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_jos?n=11:2">Chinneroth</A>, and in the lowland, and on the upland of Dor on the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_jos?n=11:2a">west</A>,

<DT><A NAME="11:4">11:4</A><DD>And they went out, they and all their <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_jos?n=11:4">armies</A> with them, a people numerous as the sand that is on the seashore in multitude, with horses and chariots very many.
<DT><A NAME="11:5">11:5</A><DD>And all these kings met together, and came and encamped together at the waters of Merom, to fight against Israel.
<DT><A NAME="11:6">11:6</A><DD>And Jehovah said to Joshua, Be not afraid because of them; for to-morrow about this time will I give them all up <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_jos?n=11:6">slain</A> before Israel: their horses shalt thou hough, and thou shalt burn their chariots with fire.
<DT><A NAME="11:7">11:7</A><DD>And Joshua, and all the people of war with him, came upon them by the waters of Merom suddenly, and fell upon them.
<DT><A NAME="11:8">11:8</A><DD>And Jehovah delivered them into the hand of Israel, and they smote them, and chased them unto great Zidon, and to Misrephoth-maim, and to the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_jos?n=11:8">valley</A> of Mizpah eastward, and smote them until none were left remaining to them.
<DT><A NAME="11:9">11:9</A><DD>And Joshua did to them as Jehovah had said to him: he houghed their horses, and burned their chariots with fire.
<DT><A NAME="11:10">11:10</A><DD>And Joshua turned back at that time, and took Hazor, and smote the king thereof with the sword; for Hazor was in times past the head of all those kingdoms.
<DT><A NAME="11:11">11:11</A><DD>And they smote all the souls that were therein with the edge of the sword, destroying them utterly: there was not any left to breathe; and he burned Hazor with fire.
<DT><A NAME="11:12">11:12</A><DD>And all the cities of those kings and all their kings did Joshua take; and he smote them with the edge of the sword, destroying them utterly, as Moses the servant of Jehovah had commanded.
<DT><A NAME="11:13">11:13</A><DD>Only, all the cities that stood still upon their <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_jos?n=11:13">hills</A> Israel did not burn, save Hazor alone, <I>which</I> Joshua burned.

<DT><A NAME="11:15">11:15</A><DD>As Jehovah had commanded Moses his servant, so did Moses command Joshua, and so did Joshua: he let <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_jos?n=11:15">nothing</A> fail of all that Jehovah had commanded Moses.

<DT><A NAME="11:18">11:18</A><DD>Joshua made war a long time with all those kings.
<DT><A NAME="11:19">11:19</A><DD>There was not a city that made peace with the children of Israel, save the Hivites who dwelt at Gibeon; they took all in battle.
<DT><A NAME="11:20">11:20</A><DD>For it was of Jehovah that their heart was hardened, to meet Israel in battle, that they might be utterly destroyed, and that there might be no favour shewn to them, but that they might be destroyed, as Jehovah had commanded Moses.
<DT><A NAME="11:21">11:21</A><DD>And Joshua came at that time and cut off the Anakim from the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_jos?n=11:21">mountains</A>, from Hebron, from Debir, from Anab, and from all the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_jos?n=11:21">mountain</A> of Judah, and from all the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_jos?n=11:21">mountain</A> of Israel: Joshua destroyed them utterly, with their cities.

<DT><A NAME="22:17">22:17</A><DD>Is the iniquity of Peor too little for us? from which we are not cleansed until this day, <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_jos?n=22:17">although</A> there was a plague in the assembly of Jehovah.
<DT><A NAME="22:18">22:18</A><DD>And ye turn away this day from following Jehovah; and it will be, that since ye rebel this day against Jehovah, to-morrow he will be wroth with the whole assembly of Israel.

<DT><A NAME="22:20">22:20</A><DD>Did not Achan the son of Zerah commit a trespass in the accursed thing? and wrath fell on all the assembly of Israel, and he perished not alone in his iniquity.
<DT><A NAME="22:21">22:21</A><DD>And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh answered and said to the heads of the thousands of Israel,

<DT><A NAME="22:24">22:24</A><DD>and if we have not done it from fear of this thing, saying, In <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_jos?n=22:24">future</A> your children will speak to our children, saying, What have ye to do with Jehovah the God of Israel?
<DT><A NAME="22:25">22:25</A><DD>Jehovah hath made the Jordan a border between us and you, ye children of Reuben and children of Gad, ye have no portion in Jehovah! And so shall your children make our children cease from fearing Jehovah.
<DT><A NAME="22:26">22:26</A><DD>And we said, Let us now set to work to build an altar, not for burnt-offering, nor for sacrifice,
<DT><A NAME="22:27">22:27</A><DD>but to be a witness between us and you, and between our generations after us, that we might do service to Jehovah before him with our burnt-offerings, and with our sacrifices, and with our peace-offerings; that your children may not say to our children in future, Ye have no portion in Jehovah.
<DT><A NAME="22:28">22:28</A><DD>And we said, If it shall be that in future they so say to us and to our generations, we will say, Behold the pattern of the altar of Jehovah which our fathers made, not for burnt-offering, nor for sacrifice, but as a witness between us and you.
<DT><A NAME="22:29">22:29</A><DD>Far be it from us that we should rebel against Jehovah, and turn this day from following Jehovah, in building an altar for burnt-offering, for oblation, and for sacrifice, besides the altar of Jehovah our God that is before his tabernacle.
<DT><A NAME="22:30">22:30</A><DD>And when Phinehas the priest and the princes of the assembly and the heads of the thousands of Israel that were with him heard the words that the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the children of Manasseh spoke, it was good in their sight.
<DT><A NAME="22:31">22:31</A><DD>And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest said unto the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the children of Manasseh, This day we perceive that Jehovah is among us, because ye have not committed this trespass against Jehovah: now have ye delivered the children of Israel out of the hand of Jehovah.
<DT><A NAME="22:32">22:32</A><DD>And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, and the princes, returned from the children of Reuben, and from the children of Gad, out of the land of Gilead, to the land of Canaan, to the children of Israel, and brought them word again.
<DT><A NAME="22:33">22:33</A><DD>And the thing was good in the sight of the children of Israel, and the children of Israel blessed God, and no more <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_jos?n=22:33">said</A> that they would go up in warfare against them, to destroy the land in which the children of Reuben and the children of Gad dwelt.
<DT><A NAME="22:34">22:34</A><DD>And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad gave a name to the altar; for it is a <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_jos?n=22:34">witness</A> between us that Jehovah is God.

<DT><A NAME="23:1">23:1</A><DD>And it came to pass a long time after that Jehovah had given rest to Israel from all their enemies round about, and Joshua had become old, advanced in <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_jos?n=23:1">age</A>,

<DT><A NAME="24:1">24:1</A><DD>And Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Shechem, and called for the elders of Israel, and for their heads, and for their judges, and for their officers; and they presented themselves before God.
<DT><A NAME="24:2">24:2</A><DD>And Joshua said unto all the people, Thus saith Jehovah the God of Israel: Your fathers dwelt of old on the other side of the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_jos?n=24:2">river</A>, Terah, the father of Abraham and the father of Nahor, and they served other gods.
<DT><A NAME="24:3">24:3</A><DD>And I took your father Abraham from the other side of the river, and led him throughout the land of Canaan, and multiplied his seed and gave him Isaac.
<DT><A NAME="24:4">24:4</A><DD>And I gave unto Isaac Jacob and Esau; and I gave unto Esau mount Seir, to possess it; and Jacob and his sons went down into Egypt.
<DT><A NAME="24:5">24:5</A><DD>And I sent Moses and Aaron, and I plagued Egypt, according to that which I did among them; and afterwards I brought you out.
<DT><A NAME="24:6">24:6</A><DD>And I brought your fathers out of Egypt, and ye came unto the sea; and the Egyptians pursued after your fathers with chariots and horsemen unto the Red sea.
<DT><A NAME="24:7">24:7</A><DD>Then they cried to Jehovah, and he put darkness between you and the Egyptians, and brought the sea upon them, and covered them; and your eyes saw what I did in <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_jos?n=24:7">Egypt</A>; and ye dwelt in the wilderness a long time.
<DT><A NAME="24:8">24:8</A><DD>And I brought you into the land of the Amorites, who dwelt beyond the Jordan, and they fought with you, and I gave them into your hand, and ye took possession of their land, and I destroyed them from before you.
<DT><A NAME="24:9">24:9</A><DD>And Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, arose and warred against Israel, and sent and called Balaam the son of Beor to curse you;
<DT><A NAME="24:10">24:10</A><DD>but I would not hearken unto Balaam, and he blessed you expressly, and I delivered you out of his hand.
<DT><A NAME="24:11">24:11</A><DD>And ye went over the Jordan, and came unto Jericho, and the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_jos?n=24:11">men</A> of Jericho fought against you, the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Girgashites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites; and I delivered them into your hand.
<DT><A NAME="24:12">24:12</A><DD>And I sent the hornet before you, which drove them out from before you, <I>as</I> the two kings of the Amorites; not with thy sword, nor with thy bow.
<DT><A NAME="24:13">24:13</A><DD>And I have given you a land for which ye did not labour, and cities which ye built not, and ye dwell in them; of vineyards and oliveyards which ye planted not do ye eat.
<DT><A NAME="24:14">24:14</A><DD>And now fear Jehovah and serve him in <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_jos?n=24:14">perfectness</A> and in truth; and put away the gods which your fathers served on the other side of the river, and in Egypt; and serve Jehovah.
<DT><A NAME="24:15">24:15</A><DD>And if it seem evil unto you to serve Jehovah, choose you this day whom ye will serve; whether the gods whom your fathers that were on the other side of the river served, or the gods of the Amorite, in whose land ye dwell; but as for me and my house, we will serve Jehovah.
<DT><A NAME="24:16">24:16</A><DD>And the people answered and said, Far be it from us that we should forsake Jehovah, to serve other gods;
<DT><A NAME="24:17">24:17</A><DD>for Jehovah our God, he it is that brought us up and our fathers out of the land of Egypt, from the house of <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_jos?n=24:17">bondage</A>, and who did those great signs before our eyes, and preserved us in all the way wherein we went, and among all the peoples through whom we passed!
<DT><A NAME="24:18">24:18</A><DD>And Jehovah drove out from before us all the peoples, and the Amorites the inhabitants of the land: so therefore we will serve Jehovah, for he is our God.
<DT><A NAME="24:19">24:19</A><DD>And Joshua said to the people, Ye cannot serve Jehovah, for he is a holy God; he is a jealous ùGod; he will not forgive your transgressions nor your sins.
<DT><A NAME="24:20">24:20</A><DD>If ye forsake Jehovah, and serve strange gods, then he will turn and do you hurt, and consume you, after that he hath done you good.
<DT><A NAME="24:21">24:21</A><DD>And the people said to Joshua, No; but we will serve Jehovah.
<DT><A NAME="24:22">24:22</A><DD>And Joshua said unto the people, Ye are witnesses against yourselves that ye have chosen you Jehovah, to serve him. And they said, <I>We are</I> witnesses.
<DT><A NAME="24:23">24:23</A><DD>Now therefore put away the strange gods that are among you, and incline your heart unto Jehovah the God of Israel.
<DT><A NAME="24:24">24:24</A><DD>And the people said unto Joshua, Jehovah our God will we serve, and to his voice will we hearken.
<DT><A NAME="24:25">24:25</A><DD>So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day, and set them a statute and an ordinance in Shechem.
<DT><A NAME="24:26">24:26</A><DD>And Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God, and took a great stone, and set it up there under the oak that was by the sanctuary of Jehovah.
<DT><A NAME="24:27">24:27</A><DD>And Joshua said unto all the people, Behold, this stone shall be a witness unto us, for it hath heard all the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_jos?n=24:27">words</A> of Jehovah which he spoke unto us; and it shall be a witness against you, lest ye deny your God.
<DT><A NAME="24:28">24:28</A><DD>And Joshua dismissed the people, every man to his inheritance.
<DT><A NAME="24:29">24:29</A><DD>And it came to pass after these things, that Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Jehovah, died, a hundred and ten years old.
<DT><A NAME="24:30">24:30</A><DD>And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnath-serah, which is in mount Ephraim, on the north side of the mountain of Gaash.
<DT><A NAME="24:31">24:31</A><DD>And Israel served Jehovah all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders whose days were prolonged after Joshua, and who had known all the works of Jehovah, which he had done for Israel.
<DT><A NAME="24:32">24:32</A><DD>And the bones of Joseph, which the children of Israel had brought up out of Egypt, buried they in Shechem in the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_jos?n=24:32">portion</A> of the field which Jacob had bought of the sons of Hamor, Shechem's father, for a hundred <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_jos?n=24:32a">kesitahs</A>; and it became the inheritance of the children of Joseph.
<DT><A NAME="24:33">24:33</A><DD>And Eleazar the son of Aaron died; and they buried him in the hill of Phinehas his son, which had been given him in mount Ephraim.
