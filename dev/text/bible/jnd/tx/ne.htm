<DT><A NAME="1:1">1:1</A><DD>The words of <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ne?n=1:1">Nehemiah</A> the son of Hachaliah. And it came to pass in the month Chislev, in the twentieth <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ne?n=1:1a">year</A>, as I was in <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ne?n=1:1b">Shushan</A> the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ne?n=1:1c">fortress</A>,
<DT><A NAME="1:2">1:2</A><DD>that Hanani, one of my brethren, came, he and <I>certain</I> men of Judah. And I asked them concerning the Jews that had escaped, who were left of the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem.
<DT><A NAME="1:3">1:3</A><DD>And they said to me, Those who remain, that are left of the captivity there in the province, are in great affliction and reproach; and the wall of Jerusalem is in ruins, and its gates are burned with fire.
<DT><A NAME="1:4">1:4</A><DD>And it came to pass, when I heard these words, that I sat and wept, and mourned for days, and fasted, and prayed before the God of the heavens,
<DT><A NAME="1:5">1:5</A><DD>and said, I beseech thee, Jehovah, God of the heavens, the great and terrible ùGod, that keepeth covenant and mercy for them that love him and keep his commandments.
<DT><A NAME="1:6">1:6</A><DD>Let thine ear now be attentive, and thine eyes open, to hear the prayer of thy servant, which I pray before thee at this <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ne?n=1:6">time</A>, day and night, for the children of Israel thy servants, confessing the sins of the children of Israel, which we have sinned against thee: both I and my father's house have sinned.
<DT><A NAME="1:7">1:7</A><DD>We have acted very perversely against thee, and have not kept the commandments, nor the statutes, nor the ordinances that thou commandedst thy servant Moses.
<DT><A NAME="1:8">1:8</A><DD>Remember, I beseech thee, the word that thou commandedst thy servant Moses, saying, If ye act unfaithfully, I will scatter you among the peoples;
<DT><A NAME="1:9">1:9</A><DD>but if ye return to me, and keep my commandments and do them, though there were of you cast out unto the uttermost part of the heavens, yet will I gather them from thence, and will bring them unto the place that I have chosen to set my name there.
<DT><A NAME="1:10">1:10</A><DD>And they are thy servants and thy people, whom thou hast redeemed by thy great power and by thy strong hand.
<DT><A NAME="1:11">1:11</A><DD>O Lord, I beseech thee, let now thine ear be attentive to the prayer of thy servant, and to the prayer of thy servants who delight to fear thy name; and prosper, I pray thee, thy servant this day, and grant him mercy in the sight of this man. Now I was the king's cupbearer.
</DL></DIV><H2>Chapter 2</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="2:1">2:1</A><DD>And it came to pass in the month Nisan, in the twentieth year of <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ne?n=2:1">Artaxerxes</A> the king, <I>that</I> wine was before him, and I took up the wine and gave it to the king. Now, I had never been sad in his presence.
<DT><A NAME="2:2">2:2</A><DD>And the king said to me, Why is thy face sad, seeing thou art not sick? this is nothing else but sadness of heart. And I was very sore afraid.
<DT><A NAME="2:3">2:3</A><DD>And I said to the king, Let the king live for ever! Why should not my countenance be sad, when the city, the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ne?n=2:3">place</A> of my fathers' sepulchres, lies waste, and its gates are consumed with fire?
<DT><A NAME="2:4">2:4</A><DD>And the king said to me, For what dost thou make request? So I prayed to the God of the heavens.
<DT><A NAME="2:5">2:5</A><DD>And I said to the king, If it please the king, and if thy servant have found favour in thy sight, that thou wouldest send me to Judah, to the city of my fathers' sepulchres, that I may build it.
<DT><A NAME="2:6">2:6</A><DD>And the king said to me -- the queen also sitting by him, -- For how long shall thy journey be, and when wilt thou return? And it pleased the king to send me; and I set him a time.
<DT><A NAME="2:7">2:7</A><DD>And I said to the king, If it please the king, let letters be given me to the governors beyond the river, that they may set me forward till I come into Judah;
<DT><A NAME="2:8">2:8</A><DD>and a letter to Asaph the keeper of the king's <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ne?n=2:8">forest</A>, that he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ne?n=2:8a">palace</A> which <I>appertains</I> to the house, and for the wall of the city, and for the house that I shall enter into. And the king granted me, according to the good hand of my God upon me.
<DT><A NAME="2:9">2:9</A><DD>And I came to the governors beyond the river, and gave them the king's letters. Now the king had sent captains of a force and horsemen with me.
<DT><A NAME="2:10">2:10</A><DD>And when Sanballat the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ne?n=2:10">Horonite</A>, and Tobijah the servant, the Ammonite, heard <I>of it</I>, it grieved them exceedingly that there had come a man to seek the welfare of the children of Israel.
<DT><A NAME="2:11">2:11</A><DD>And I came to Jerusalem, and was there three days.
<DT><A NAME="2:12">2:12</A><DD>And I arose in the night, I and some few men with me -- but I told no man what my God had put in my heart to do for Jerusalem -- and there was no beast with me, except the beast that I rode upon.
<DT><A NAME="2:13">2:13</A><DD>And I went out by night by the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ne?n=2:13">valley-gate</A>, even toward the jackal-fountain, and to the dung-gate; and I viewed the walls of Jerusalem, which were in ruins, and its gates were consumed with fire.
<DT><A NAME="2:14">2:14</A><DD>And I went on to the fountain-gate, and to the king's pool; and there was no place for the beast under me to pass.
<DT><A NAME="2:15">2:15</A><DD>And I went up in the night through the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ne?n=2:15">valley</A>, and viewed the wall, and turned back, and entered by the valley-gate and returned.
<DT><A NAME="2:16">2:16</A><DD>And the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ne?n=2:16">rulers</A> did not know whither I went or what I did, for I had not as yet told it to the Jews, nor to the priests, nor to the nobles, nor to the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ne?n=2:16">rulers</A>, nor to the rest that did the work.
<DT><A NAME="2:17">2:17</A><DD>And I said to them, Ye see the distress that we are in, that Jerusalem lies waste, and its gates are burned with fire. Come, and let us build up the wall of Jerusalem, that we be no more a reproach.
<DT><A NAME="2:18">2:18</A><DD>And I told them of the hand of my God which had been good upon me; as also of the king's words which he had said unto me. And they said, Let us rise up and build. And they strengthened their hands for the good <I>work</I>.
<DT><A NAME="2:19">2:19</A><DD>And Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobijah the servant, the Ammonite, and <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ne?n=2:19">Geshem</A> the Arabian, heard it; and they mocked us and despised us, and said, What is this thing which ye do? will ye rebel against the king?
<DT><A NAME="2:20">2:20</A><DD>And I answered them, and said to them, The God of the heavens, he will prosper us, and we his servants will arise and build; but ye have no portion, nor right, nor memorial in Jerusalem.

</DL></DIV><H2>Chapter 4</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="4:1">4:1</A><DD>And it came to pass that when Sanballat heard that we built the wall, he was angry and very indignant, and mocked the Jews.
<DT><A NAME="4:2">4:2</A><DD>And he spoke before his brethren and the army of Samaria, and said, What do these feeble Jews? shall they be permitted to go on? Will they offer sacrifices? Will they finish in a day? Will they revive the stones out of the heaps of rubbish, when they are burned?
<DT><A NAME="4:3">4:3</A><DD>And Tobijah the Ammonite was by him, and he said, Even that which they build, if a fox went up, it would break down their stone wall. --
<DT><A NAME="4:4">4:4</A><DD>Hear, our God, for we are despised, and turn their reproach upon their own head, and give them for a <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ne?n=4:4">prey</A> in a land of captivity!
<DT><A NAME="4:5">4:5</A><DD>And cover not their iniquity, and let not their sin be blotted out from before thee; for they have provoked the builders.
<DT><A NAME="4:6">4:6</A><DD>But we built the wall; and all the wall was joined together to the half thereof; for the people had a <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ne?n=4:6">mind</A> to work.
<DT><A NAME="4:7">4:7</A><DD>And it came to pass, when Sanballat, and Tobijah, and the Arabians, and the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites heard that the walls of Jerusalem were being repaired, that the breaches began to be stopped, then they were very wroth,
<DT><A NAME="4:8">4:8</A><DD>and conspired all of them together to come to fight against Jerusalem, and to <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ne?n=4:8">hinder</A> it.
<DT><A NAME="4:9">4:9</A><DD>Then we prayed to our God, and set a watch against them day and night, because of them.
<DT><A NAME="4:10">4:10</A><DD>And Judah said, The strength of the bearers of burdens faileth, and there is much rubbish; so that we are not able to build at the wall.
<DT><A NAME="4:11">4:11</A><DD>And our <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ne?n=4:11">adversaries</A> said, They shall not know, neither see, till we come into the midst of them and kill them, and put an end to the work.
<DT><A NAME="4:12">4:12</A><DD>And it came to pass that when the Jews that dwelt by them came and told us so ten times, from all the places whence they <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ne?n=4:12">returned</A> to us,
<DT><A NAME="4:13">4:13</A><DD>I set in the lower places behind the wall in exposed places, I even set the people, according to their families, with their swords, their spears and their bows.
<DT><A NAME="4:14">4:14</A><DD>And I looked, and rose up, and said to the nobles, and to the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ne?n=4:14">rulers</A>, and to the rest of the people, Be not afraid of them: remember the Lord who is great and terrible, and fight for your brethren, your sons and your daughters, your wives and your houses.
<DT><A NAME="4:15">4:15</A><DD>And it came to pass that when our enemies heard that it was known to us, and that God had defeated their counsel, we returned all of us to the wall, every one to his work.
<DT><A NAME="4:16">4:16</A><DD>And from that time forth the half of my servants wrought in the work, and the other half of them held the spears, and the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ne?n=4:16">shields</A>, and the bows, and the corslets; and the captains were behind all the house of Judah.
<DT><A NAME="4:17">4:17</A><DD>They that built on the wall, and they that bore burdens, with those that loaded, wrought in the work with one hand, and with the other they held a weapon.
<DT><A NAME="4:18">4:18</A><DD>And the builders had every one his sword girded by his side, and built. And he that sounded the trumpet was by me.
<DT><A NAME="4:19">4:19</A><DD>And I said to the nobles, and to the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ne?n=4:14">rulers</A>, and to the rest of the people, The work is great and extended, and we are scattered upon the wall, one far from another:
<DT><A NAME="4:20">4:20</A><DD>in what place ye hear the sound of the trumpet, thither shall ye assemble to us; our God will fight for us.

<DT><A NAME="6:2">6:2</A><DD>that Sanballat and Geshem sent to me, saying, Come, let us meet together in the villages in the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ne?n=6:2">plain</A> of Ono. But they thought to do me mischief.
<DT><A NAME="6:3">6:3</A><DD>And I sent messengers to them, saying, I am doing a great work, and I cannot come down. Why should the work cease, whilst I leave it and come down to you?
<DT><A NAME="6:4">6:4</A><DD>And they sent to me four times after this sort; and I answered them in the same manner.
<DT><A NAME="6:5">6:5</A><DD>Then sent Sanballat his <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ne?n=6:5">servant</A> to me in this manner the fifth time, with an open letter in his hand,
<DT><A NAME="6:6">6:6</A><DD>in which was written: It is reported among the nations, and Gashmu says <I>it, that</I> thou and the Jews think to rebel, for which cause thou buildest the wall, and according to these words thou wilt become their king.
<DT><A NAME="6:7">6:7</A><DD>And thou hast also appointed prophets to proclaim concerning thee at Jerusalem saying, There is a king in Judah! And now it will be reported to the king according to these words. Come now therefore, and let us take counsel together.
<DT><A NAME="6:8">6:8</A><DD>And I sent to him, saying, There are no such things done as thou sayest, but thou feignest them out of thine own heart.
<DT><A NAME="6:9">6:9</A><DD>For they all would have made us afraid, saying, Their hands shall be slackened from the work, that it be not carried out. -- Now therefore strengthen my hands!
<DT><A NAME="6:10">6:10</A><DD>And I came to the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah, the son of Mehetabeel, who had shut himself up. And he said, Let us meet together in the house of God, within the temple, and let us shut the doors of the temple; for they are coming to kill thee; even in the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ne?n=6:10">night</A> are they coming to kill thee.
<DT><A NAME="6:11">6:11</A><DD>And I said, Should such a man as I flee? and who is there, that, being as I am, could go into the temple, and live? I will not go in.
<DT><A NAME="6:12">6:12</A><DD>And I perceived, and behold, God had not sent him; for he pronounced this prophecy against me; and Tobijah and Sanballat had hired him.
<DT><A NAME="6:13">6:13</A><DD>Therefore was he hired, that I should be afraid, and do so, and sin, and that they might have wherewith to spread an evil report, that they might reproach me.
<DT><A NAME="6:14">6:14</A><DD>My God, remember Tobijah and Sanballat according to these their works, and also the prophetess Noadiah, and the rest of the prophets who would have put me in fear.
<DT><A NAME="6:15">6:15</A><DD>So the wall was finished on the twenty-fifth of Elul, in fifty-two days.
<DT><A NAME="6:16">6:16</A><DD>And it came to pass that when all our enemies heard <I>of it</I>, all the nations that were about us were afraid and were much cast down in their own eyes, and they perceived that this work was wrought by our God.
<DT><A NAME="6:17">6:17</A><DD>Moreover in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters to Tobijah, and those of Tobijah came to them.
<DT><A NAME="6:18">6:18</A><DD>For there were many in Judah sworn to him; for he was a son-in-law of Shechaniah the son of Arah; and his son Johanan had taken the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah.
<DT><A NAME="6:19">6:19</A><DD>Also they spoke of his good <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ne?n=6:19">deeds</A> before me, and reported my <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ne?n=6:19a">words</A> to him. <I>And</I> Tobijah sent letters to put me in fear.

<DT><A NAME="12:23">12:23</A><DD>The children of Levi, the chief fathers, were recorded in the book of the chronicles, even until the days of <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ne?n=12:22">Johanan</A> the son of Eliashib.
<DT><A NAME="12:24">12:24</A><DD>And the chief Levites: Hashabiah, Sherebiah, and Jeshua the son of Kadmiel, with their brethren over against them, to praise <I>and</I> to give thanks, according to the commandment of David the man of God, ward over against ward.
<DT><A NAME="12:25">12:25</A><DD>Mattaniah and Bakbukiah, Obadiah, Meshullam, Talmon, Akkub, were doorkeepers keeping the ward at the storehouses of the gates.
<DT><A NAME="12:26">12:26</A><DD>These were in the days of Joiakim the son of Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and in the days of Nehemiah the governor, and of Ezra the priest, the scribe.
<DT><A NAME="12:27">12:27</A><DD>And at the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem they sought the Levites out of all their places, to bring them to Jerusalem, to hold the dedication with gladness, both with thanksgivings, and with singing, <I>with</I> cymbals, lutes and harps.
<DT><A NAME="12:28">12:28</A><DD>And the children of the singers were assembled, both from the plain <I>of Jordan</I> round about Jerusalem, and from the villages of the Netophathites,
<DT><A NAME="12:29">12:29</A><DD>also from <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ne?n=12:29">Beth-Gilgal</A>, and out of the fields of Geba and Azmaveth; for the singers had built themselves <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ne?n=12:29a">hamlets</A> round about Jerusalem.
<DT><A NAME="12:30">12:30</A><DD>And the priests and the Levites purified themselves; and they purified the people, and the gates and the wall.
<DT><A NAME="12:31">12:31</A><DD>And I brought up the princes of Judah upon the wall, and appointed two great choirs and processions, on the right hand upon the wall towards the dung-gate.
<DT><A NAME="12:32">12:32</A><DD>And after them went Hoshaiah, and half of the princes of Judah,
<DT><A NAME="12:33">12:33</A><DD>and Azariah, Ezra, and Meshullam,
<DT><A NAME="12:34">12:34</A><DD>Judah and Benjamin, and Shemaiah, and Jeremiah,
<DT><A NAME="12:35">12:35</A><DD>and <I>certain</I> of the priests' sons with trumpets: Zechariah the son of Jonathan, the son of Shemaiah, the son of Mattaniah, the son of Micaiah, the son of Zaccur, the son of Asaph;
<DT><A NAME="12:36">12:36</A><DD>and his brethren, Shemaiah, and Azareel, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethaneel, and Judah, Hanani, with the musical instruments of David the man of God; and Ezra the scribe before them.
<DT><A NAME="12:37">12:37</A><DD>And at the fountain-gate, and over against them, they went up by the stairs of the city of David, at the ascent of the wall, above the house of David, even to the water-gate eastward.
<DT><A NAME="12:38">12:38</A><DD>And the second choir went in the opposite direction upon the wall, and I after them, and the half of the people, from beyond the tower of the furnaces even to the broad wall;
<DT><A NAME="12:39">12:39</A><DD>and from above the gate of Ephraim, and above the gate of the old <I>wall</I>, and above the fish-gate, and the tower of Hananeel, and the tower of Meah, even to the sheep-gate; and they stood still in the prison-gate.
<DT><A NAME="12:40">12:40</A><DD>And both choirs stood in the house of God, and I, and the half of the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ne?n=12:40">rulers</A> with me;
<DT><A NAME="12:41">12:41</A><DD>and the priests, Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Micaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah, Hananiah, with trumpets;
<DT><A NAME="12:42">12:42</A><DD>and Maaseiah, and Shemaiah, and Eleazar, and Uzzi, and Jehohanan, and Malchijah, and Elam, and Ezer. And the singers sang loud; and Jizrahiah was their overseer.
<DT><A NAME="12:43">12:43</A><DD>And that day they <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ne?n=12:43">offered</A> great sacrifices, and rejoiced: for God had made them rejoice with great joy; and also the women and the children rejoiced. And the joy of Jerusalem was heard even afar off.
<DT><A NAME="12:44">12:44</A><DD>And at that <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ne?n=12:44">time</A> men were appointed over the chambers of the treasures for the heave-offerings, for the first-fruits, and for the tithes, to gather into them, out of the fields of the cities, the portions assigned by the law for the priests and the Levites; for Judah rejoiced over the priests, and over the Levites that waited.
<DT><A NAME="12:45">12:45</A><DD>And, with the singers and the doorkeepers, they kept the ward of their God, and the ward of the purification, according to the commandment of David <I>and</I> of Solomon his son.
<DT><A NAME="12:46">12:46</A><DD>For of old, in the days of David and Asaph, there were the chiefs of the singers, and songs of praise and thanksgivings to God.
<DT><A NAME="12:47">12:47</A><DD>And all Israel, in the days of Zerubbabel and in the days of Nehemiah, gave the portions of the singers and the doorkeepers, every day what was needed, and they <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ne?n=12:47">consecrated</A> things for the Levites; and the Levites consecrated for the children of Aaron.
</DL></DIV><H2>Chapter 13</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="13:1">13:1</A><DD>On that <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ne?n=13:1">day</A> they read in the book of Moses in the audience of the people; and there was found written in it that the Ammonite and the Moabite should not come into the congregation of God for ever;
<DT><A NAME="13:2">13:2</A><DD>because they had not met the children of Israel with bread and with water, and had hired Balaam against them, to curse them; but our God turned the curse into blessing.
<DT><A NAME="13:3">13:3</A><DD>And it came to pass, when they heard the law, that they separated from Israel all the mixed multitude.
<DT><A NAME="13:4">13:4</A><DD>And before this, Eliashib the priest, who had the oversight of the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ne?n=13:4">chambers</A> of the house of our God, a kinsman of Tobijah,
<DT><A NAME="13:5">13:5</A><DD>had prepared for him a great chamber, where formerly they laid the oblations, the frankincense, and the vessels, and the tithes of the corn, the new wine and the oil, which was commanded for the Levites and the singers and the doorkeepers, and the heave-offerings of the priests.
<DT><A NAME="13:6">13:6</A><DD>And during all that <I>time</I> I was not at Jerusalem; for in the two-and-thirtieth year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon I came to the king; and after some time I obtained leave of the king.
<DT><A NAME="13:7">13:7</A><DD>And I came to Jerusalem, and observed the evil that Eliashib had done for Tobijah, in preparing him a chamber in the courts of the house of God.
<DT><A NAME="13:8">13:8</A><DD>And it grieved me much, and I cast forth all the household stuff of Tobijah out of the chamber.
<DT><A NAME="13:9">13:9</A><DD>And I commanded, and they purified the chambers; and thither brought I again the vessels of the house of God, the oblation and the frankincense.
<DT><A NAME="13:10">13:10</A><DD>And I perceived that the portions of the Levites had not been given, and that the Levites and the singers that did the work had fled every one to his field.
<DT><A NAME="13:11">13:11</A><DD>Then I contended with the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ne?n=13:11">rulers</A>, and said, Why is the house of God forsaken? And I gathered them <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ne?n=13:11a">together</A> and set them in their place.
<DT><A NAME="13:12">13:12</A><DD>And all Judah brought the tithe of the corn and the new wine and the oil into the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ne?n=13:12">storehouses</A>.
<DT><A NAME="13:13">13:13</A><DD>And I made storekeepers over the storehouses: Shelemiah the priest, and Zadok the scribe, and of the Levites, Pedaiah; and subordinate to them, Hanan the son of Zaccur, the son of Mattaniah; for they were esteemed faithful, and their office was to distribute to their brethren.
<DT><A NAME="13:14">13:14</A><DD>Remember me, O my God, concerning this, and wipe not out my good <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ne?n=13:14">deeds</A> which I have done for the house of my God, and for the charges thereof!
<DT><A NAME="13:15">13:15</A><DD>In those days I saw in Judah some treading winepresses on the sabbath, and bringing in sheaves, and lading them on asses; as also wine, grapes and figs, and all manner of burdens; and they brought them into Jerusalem on the sabbath day; and I protested in the day on which they sold the victuals.
<DT><A NAME="13:16">13:16</A><DD>Men of Tyre also dwelt therein, who brought fish and all manner of ware, and sold it on the sabbath to the children of Judah, and in Jerusalem.
<DT><A NAME="13:17">13:17</A><DD>And I contended with the nobles of Judah, and said to them, What evil thing is this which ye do, profaning the sabbath day?
<DT><A NAME="13:18">13:18</A><DD>Did not your fathers thus, and did not our God bring all this evil upon us and upon this city? And ye will bring more wrath against Israel by profaning the sabbath.
<DT><A NAME="13:19">13:19</A><DD>And it came to pass, that when it began to be dark in the gates of Jerusalem before the sabbath, I commanded that the gates should be shut; and I commanded that they should not be opened till after the sabbath. And I set <I>some</I> of my <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ne?n=13:19">servants</A> at the gates, so that no burden should be brought in on the sabbath day.
<DT><A NAME="13:20">13:20</A><DD>And the dealers and sellers of all kind of ware passed the night without Jerusalem once or twice.
<DT><A NAME="13:21">13:21</A><DD>And I testified against them, and said to them, Why do ye pass the night before the wall? if ye do so again, I will lay hands on you. From that time forth they came not on the sabbath.
<DT><A NAME="13:22">13:22</A><DD>And I commanded the Levites that they should purify themselves, and that they should come and keep the gates, to hallow the sabbath day. Remember this also for me, my God, and spare me according to thy great loving-kindness!
<DT><A NAME="13:23">13:23</A><DD>In those days also I saw Jews that had married wives of Ashdod, of Ammon, <I>and</I> of Moab.
<DT><A NAME="13:24">13:24</A><DD>And their children spoke half in the language of Ashdod, and could not speak in the Jews' language, but according to the language of each people.
<DT><A NAME="13:25">13:25</A><DD>And I contended with them, and cursed them, and smote certain of them and plucked off their hair, and adjured them by God <I>saying</I>, Ye shall not give your daughters to their sons, nor take their daughters for your sons or for yourselves.
<DT><A NAME="13:26">13:26</A><DD>Did not Solomon king of Israel sin by these things? Yet among the many nations was there no king like him, who was beloved of his God, and God made him king over all Israel; but even him did foreign wives cause to sin.
<DT><A NAME="13:27">13:27</A><DD>And should we hearken to you to do all this great evil, to act unfaithfully to our God by marrying foreign wives?
<DT><A NAME="13:28">13:28</A><DD>And <I>one</I> of the sons of Joiada, the son of Eliashib the high priest, was son-in-law to Sanballat the Horonite; and I chased him from me.
<DT><A NAME="13:29">13:29</A><DD>Remember them, my God, for they are polluters of the priesthood, and of the covenant of the priesthood and of the Levites!
<DT><A NAME="13:30">13:30</A><DD>And I purified them from all foreigners, and appointed the charges of the priests and the Levites, every one in his <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ne?n=13:30">service</A>;
<DT><A NAME="13:31">13:31</A><DD>and for the wood-offering, at times appointed, and for the first-fruits. Remember me, O my God, for good!
