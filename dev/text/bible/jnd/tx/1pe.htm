<DT><A NAME="1:13">1:13</A><DD>Wherefore, having girded up the loins of your mind, <I>be</I> sober <I>and</I> hope with perfect stedfastness in the grace <I>which will be</I> brought to you at <I>the</I> revelation of Jesus Christ;
<DT><A NAME="1:14">1:14</A><DD>as children of obedience, not <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1pe?n=1:14">conformed</A> to <I>your</I> former lusts in your ignorance;

<DT><A NAME="1:20">1:20</A><DD>foreknown indeed before <I>the</I> foundation of <I>the</I> world, but who has been manifested at the end of times for your sakes,

<DT><A NAME="1:22">1:22</A><DD>Having purified your souls by obedience to the truth to unfeigned brotherly love, love one another out of a pure heart fervently;

<DT><A NAME="2:1">2:1</A><DD>Laying aside therefore all malice and all guile and hypocrisies and envyings and all evil speakings,

<DT><A NAME="2:3">2:3</A><DD>if indeed ye have tasted that the Lord <I>is</I> good.
<DT><A NAME="2:4">2:4</A><DD>To whom coming, a living stone, cast away indeed as worthless by men, but with God chosen, precious,
<DT><A NAME="2:5">2:5</A><DD>yourselves also, as living stones, are being built up a spiritual house, a holy priesthood, to offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.
<DT><A NAME="2:6">2:6</A><DD>Because it is contained in the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1pe?n=2:6">scripture</A>: Behold, I lay in Zion a corner stone, elect, precious: and he that believes on <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1pe?n=2:6a">him</A> shall not be put to shame.
<DT><A NAME="2:7">2:7</A><DD>To you therefore who believe <I>is</I> the preciousness; but to the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1pe?n=2:7">disobedient</A>, the stone which the builders cast away as worthless, this is become head of <I>the</I> <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1pe?n=2:7a">corner</A>,
<DT><A NAME="2:8">2:8</A><DD>and a stone of stumbling and rock of <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1pe?n=2:8">offence</A>; <I>who</I> stumble at the word, being <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1pe?n=2:7">disobedient</A> to which also they have been appointed.

<DT><A NAME="2:10">2:10</A><DD>who once <I>were</I> not a people, but now God's people; who were not enjoying mercy, but now have found <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1pe?n=2:10">mercy</A>.
<DT><A NAME="2:11">2:11</A><DD>Beloved, I exhort <I>you</I>, as strangers and <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1pe?n=2:11">sojourners</A>, to abstain from fleshly lusts, <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1pe?n=2:11a">which</A> war against the soul;

<DT><A NAME="2:15">2:15</A><DD>Because so is the will of God, that by well-doing ye put to silence the ignorance of senseless <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1pe?n=2:15">men</A>;
<DT><A NAME="2:16">2:16</A><DD>as free, and not as having liberty as a cloak of <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1pe?n=2:16">malice</A>, but as God's bondmen.

<DT><A NAME="2:21">2:21</A><DD>For to this have ye been called; for Christ also has suffered for you, leaving you a <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1pe?n=2:21">model</A> that ye should follow in his steps:
<DT><A NAME="2:22">2:22</A><DD>who did no sin, neither was guile found in his <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1pe?n=2:22">mouth</A>;
<DT><A NAME="2:23">2:23</A><DD>who, <I>when</I> reviled, reviled not again; <I>when</I> suffering, threatened not; but gave <I>himself</I> over <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1pe?n=2:23">into</A> the hands of him who judges righteously;

<DT><A NAME="3:1">3:1</A><DD>Likewise, wives, <I>be</I> <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1pe?n=3:1">subject</A> to your own husbands, that, even if any are disobedient to the word, they may be gained without <I>the</I> word by the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1pe?n=3:1a">conversation</A> of the wives,
<DT><A NAME="3:2">3:2</A><DD>having witnessed your pure <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1pe?n=3:1a">conversation</A> <I>carried out</I> in fear;
<DT><A NAME="3:3">3:3</A><DD>whose adorning let it not be that outward one of tressing of hair, and wearing gold, or putting on apparel;
<DT><A NAME="3:4">3:4</A><DD>but the hidden man of the heart, in the incorruptible <I>ornament</I> of a meek and quiet spirit, which in the sight of God is of great price.
<DT><A NAME="3:5">3:5</A><DD>For thus also the holy women who have <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1pe?n=3:5">hoped</A> in God heretofore adorned themselves, being <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1pe?n=3:1">subject</A> to their own husbands;

<DT><A NAME="3:8">3:8</A><DD>Finally, <I>be</I> all of one mind, sympathising, full of brotherly love, tender hearted, humble minded;

<DT><A NAME="3:10">3:10</A><DD>For he that will love life and see good days, let him cause his tongue to cease from evil and his lips that they speak no guile.
<DT><A NAME="3:11">3:11</A><DD>And let him avoid evil, and do good; let him seek peace and pursue it;

<DT><A NAME="3:14">3:14</A><DD>But if also ye should suffer for righteousness' sake, blessed <I>are ye</I>; but be not afraid of their fear, neither be troubled;

<DT><A NAME="3:17">3:17</A><DD>For <I>it is</I> better, if the will of God should will it, to suffer <I>as</I> well-doers than <I>as</I> evildoers;
<DT><A NAME="3:18">3:18</A><DD>for Christ indeed has once suffered for sins, <I>the</I> just for <I>the</I> <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1pe?n=3:18">unjust</A>, that he might bring us to God; being put to death in flesh, but made alive in <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1pe?n=3:18a"><I>the</I></A> Spirit,
