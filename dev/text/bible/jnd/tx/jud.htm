<H2>Chapter 1</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="1:1">1:1</A><DD>And it came to pass after the death of Joshua that the children of Israel asked Jehovah, saying, Which of us shall go up against the Canaanites first, to fight against them?
<DT><A NAME="1:2">1:2</A><DD>And Jehovah said, Judah shall go up: behold, I have delivered the land into his hand.
<DT><A NAME="1:3">1:3</A><DD>And Judah said to Simeon his brother, Come up with me into my lot, and let us fight against the Canaanites, and I likewise will go with thee into thy lot; and Simeon went with him.
<DT><A NAME="1:4">1:4</A><DD>And Judah went up; and Jehovah delivered the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hand, and they smote them in Bezek, ten thousand men.
<DT><A NAME="1:5">1:5</A><DD>And they found Adoni-Bezek in Bezek, and fought against him, and they smote the Canaanites and the Perizzites.
<DT><A NAME="1:6">1:6</A><DD>And Adoni-Bezek fled, and they pursued after him, and caught him, and cut off his thumbs and his great toes.
<DT><A NAME="1:7">1:7</A><DD>And Adoni-Bezek said, Seventy kings, with their thumbs and their great toes cut off, gleaned under my table: as I have done, so God has requited me. And they brought him to Jerusalem, and there he died.
<DT><A NAME="1:8">1:8</A><DD>And the children of Judah <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_jud?n=1:8">fought</A> against Jerusalem, and took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and set the city on fire.
<DT><A NAME="1:9">1:9</A><DD>And afterwards the children of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites, that dwelt in the hill-country, and in the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_jud?n=1:9">south</A>, and in the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_jud?n=1:9a">lowland</A>.
<DT><A NAME="1:10">1:10</A><DD>And Judah went against the Canaanites that dwelt in Hebron -- the name of Hebron before was <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_jud?n=1:10">Kirjath-Arba</A>; and they slew Sheshai and Ahiman and Talmai.
<DT><A NAME="1:11">1:11</A><DD>And from there he went against the inhabitants of Debir; now the name of Debir before was <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_jud?n=1:11">Kirjath-sepher</A>.
<DT><A NAME="1:12">1:12</A><DD>And Caleb said, He that smites Kirjath-sepher and takes it, to him will I give Achsah my daughter as wife.
<DT><A NAME="1:13">1:13</A><DD>And Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother, took it; and he gave him Achsah his daughter as wife.
<DT><A NAME="1:14">1:14</A><DD>And it came to pass as she came, that she urged him to ask of her father the field; and she sprang down from the ass. And Caleb said to her, What wouldest thou?
<DT><A NAME="1:15">1:15</A><DD>And she said to him, Give me a blessing; for thou hast given me a southern <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_jud?n=1:15">land</A>; give me also springs of water. And Caleb gave her the upper springs and the lower springs.
<DT><A NAME="1:16">1:16</A><DD>And the children of the Kenite, Moses' father-in-law, had gone up out of the city of palm-trees with the children of Judah into the wilderness of Judah, which is in the south of <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_jud?n=1:16">Arad</A>; and they went and dwelt with the people.
<DT><A NAME="1:17">1:17</A><DD>And Judah went with Simeon his brother, and they slew the Canaanites that inhabited Zephath, and utterly destroyed it; and they called the name of the city <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_jud?n=1:17">Hormah</A>.
<DT><A NAME="1:18">1:18</A><DD>And Judah took Gazah and its border, and Ashkelon and its border, and Ekron and its border.
<DT><A NAME="1:19">1:19</A><DD>And Jehovah was with Judah; and he took possession of the hill-country, for he did not dispossess the inhabitants of the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_jud?n=1:19">valley</A>, because they had chariots of iron.
<DT><A NAME="1:20">1:20</A><DD>And they gave to Caleb Hebron, as Moses had said; and he dispossessed from thence the three sons of Anak.
<DT><A NAME="1:21">1:21</A><DD>And the children of Benjamin did not dispossess the Jebusites, the inhabitants of Jerusalem; but the Jebusites dwell with the children of Benjamin in Jerusalem to this day.
<DT><A NAME="1:22">1:22</A><DD>And the house of Joseph, they also went up against Bethel; and Jehovah was with them.
<DT><A NAME="1:23">1:23</A><DD>And the house of Joseph sent to search out Bethel; now the name of the city before was Luz.
<DT><A NAME="1:24">1:24</A><DD>And the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_jud?n=1:24">guards</A> saw a man come forth out of the city, and said unto him, Shew us, we pray thee, how <I>we</I> may enter into the city, and we will shew thee kindness.
<DT><A NAME="1:25">1:25</A><DD>And he shewed them how to enter into the city. And they smote the city with the edge of the sword; but they let go the man and all his family.
<DT><A NAME="1:26">1:26</A><DD>And the man went into the land of the Hittites, and built a city, and called its name Luz, which is its name to this day.
<DT><A NAME="1:27">1:27</A><DD>And Manasseh did not dispossess Beth-shean and its dependent <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_jud?n=1:27">villages</A>, nor Taanach and its dependent villages, nor the inhabitants of Dor and its dependent villages, nor the inhabitants of Ibleam and its dependent villages, nor the inhabitants of Megiddo and its dependent villages; and the Canaanites would dwell in that land.
<DT><A NAME="1:28">1:28</A><DD>And it came to pass when Israel became strong, that they made the Canaanites tributary; but they did not utterly dispossess them.
<DT><A NAME="1:29">1:29</A><DD>And Ephraim did not dispossess the Canaanites that dwelt in Gezer; but the Canaanites dwelt among them in Gezer.
<DT><A NAME="1:30">1:30</A><DD>Zebulun did not dispossess the inhabitants of Kitron, nor the inhabitants of Nahalol; but the Canaanites dwelt among them, and became tributaries.
<DT><A NAME="1:31">1:31</A><DD>Asher did not dispossess the inhabitants of Accho, nor the inhabitants of Zidon, nor Ahlab, nor Achzib, nor Helbah, nor Aphik, nor Rehob;
<DT><A NAME="1:32">1:32</A><DD>and the Asherites dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land; for they did not dispossess them.
<DT><A NAME="1:33">1:33</A><DD>Naphtali did not dispossess the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh, nor the inhabitants of Beth-anath; and he dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land, but the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh and of Beth-anath became tributaries to them.
<DT><A NAME="1:34">1:34</A><DD>And the Amorites forced the children of Dan into the hill-country, for they would not suffer them to come down to the valley.
<DT><A NAME="1:35">1:35</A><DD>And the Amorites would dwell on mount Heres, in Ajalon and in Shaalbim; but the hand of the house of Joseph prevailed, and they became tributaries.
<DT><A NAME="1:36">1:36</A><DD>And the border of the Amorites was from the ascent of Akrabbim, from the rock, and upwards.
</DL></DIV><H2>Chapter 2</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="2:1">2:1</A><DD>And the Angel of Jehovah came up from Gilgal to Bochim, and said, I made you to go up out of Egypt, and have brought you to the land which I swore unto your fathers; and I said, I will never break my covenant with you; and as for you,
<DT><A NAME="2:2">2:2</A><DD>ye shall make no covenant with the inhabitants of this land; ye shall throw down their altars: but ye have not hearkened unto my voice. Why have ye done this?
<DT><A NAME="2:3">2:3</A><DD>Wherefore I also said, I will not drive them out from before you; but they shall be <I>scourges</I> in your <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_jud?n=2:3">sides</A>, and their gods shall be a snare unto you.
<DT><A NAME="2:4">2:4</A><DD>And it came to pass, when the Angel of Jehovah spoke these words to all the children of Israel, that the people lifted up their voice and wept.
<DT><A NAME="2:5">2:5</A><DD>And they called the name of that place <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_jud?n=2:5">Bochim</A>; and they sacrificed there to Jehovah.
<DT><A NAME="2:6">2:6</A><DD>And Joshua dismissed the people, and the children of Israel went every man to his inheritance to possess the land.
<DT><A NAME="2:7">2:7</A><DD>And the people served Jehovah all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders whose days were prolonged after Joshua, who had seen all the great works of Jehovah, which he had done for Israel.
<DT><A NAME="2:8">2:8</A><DD>And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Jehovah, died, a hundred and ten years old.
<DT><A NAME="2:9">2:9</A><DD>And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_jud?n=2:9">Timnath-Heres</A>, in mount Ephraim, on the north side of the mountain of Gaash.
<DT><A NAME="2:10">2:10</A><DD>And also all that generation were gathered to their fathers; and there arose another generation after them, which knew not Jehovah, nor yet the works which he had done for Israel.
<DT><A NAME="2:11">2:11</A><DD>And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of Jehovah, and served the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_jud?n=2:11">Baals</A>.
<DT><A NAME="2:12">2:12</A><DD>And they forsook Jehovah the God of their fathers, who had brought them up out of the land of Egypt, and followed other gods of the gods of the peoples that were round about them, and bowed themselves to them, and provoked Jehovah to anger.
<DT><A NAME="2:13">2:13</A><DD>And they forsook Jehovah, and served Baal and the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_jud?n=2:11">Ashtoreths</A>.
<DT><A NAME="2:14">2:14</A><DD>And the anger of Jehovah was hot against Israel, and he delivered them into the hands of spoilers that spoiled them, and he sold them into the hands of their enemies round about; and they could not any longer stand before their enemies.
<DT><A NAME="2:15">2:15</A><DD>Whithersoever they went out the hand of Jehovah was against them for evil, as Jehovah had said, and as Jehovah had sworn unto them; and they were greatly distressed.
<DT><A NAME="2:16">2:16</A><DD>And Jehovah raised up judges, and they saved them out of the hand of those that spoiled them.
<DT><A NAME="2:17">2:17</A><DD>But they did not even hearken to their judges, for they went a whoring after other gods, and bowed themselves to them; they turned quickly out of the way that their fathers had walked in, obeying the commandments of Jehovah; they did not so.
<DT><A NAME="2:18">2:18</A><DD>And when Jehovah raised them up judges, then Jehovah was with the judge, and saved them out of the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge; for it repented <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_jud?n=2:18">Jehovah</A> because of their groanings by reason of them that oppressed them and crushed them.
<DT><A NAME="2:19">2:19</A><DD>And it came to pass when the judge died, that they turned back and corrupted themselves more than their fathers, in following other gods to serve them, and to bow down to them: they ceased not from their own doings, nor from their stubborn way.
<DT><A NAME="2:20">2:20</A><DD>And the anger of Jehovah was hot against Israel; and he said, Because this nation hath transgressed my covenant which I commanded their fathers, and hath not hearkened unto my voice,
<DT><A NAME="2:21">2:21</A><DD>I also will not henceforth dispossess from before them any of the nations that Joshua left when he died;
<DT><A NAME="2:22">2:22</A><DD>that through them I may prove Israel, whether they will keep the way of Jehovah to walk therein, as their fathers did keep <I>it</I>, or not.
<DT><A NAME="2:23">2:23</A><DD>Therefore Jehovah left those nations, without dispossessing them hastily, neither delivered he them into the hand of Joshua.
</DL></DIV><H2>Chapter 3</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="3:1">3:1</A><DD>And these are the nations that Jehovah left, to prove Israel by them, all that had not known all the wars of Canaan;
<DT><A NAME="3:2">3:2</A><DD>only that the generations of the children of Israel might know war by learning it, at the least those who before had known nothing thereof:
<DT><A NAME="3:3">3:3</A><DD>five lord <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_jud?n=3:3">ships</A> of the Philistines, and all the Canaanites, and the Sidonians, and the Hivites that dwell on mount Lebanon; from mount Baal-Hermon unto the entering into Hamath.
<DT><A NAME="3:4">3:4</A><DD>And they were to prove Israel by them, to know whether they would obey the commandments of Jehovah, which he commanded their fathers by the hand of Moses.
<DT><A NAME="3:5">3:5</A><DD>And the children of Israel dwelt among the Canaanites: Hittites and Amorites and Perizzites and Hivites and Jebusites;
<DT><A NAME="3:6">3:6</A><DD>and they took their daughters as wives, and gave their daughters to their sons, and served their gods.
<DT><A NAME="3:7">3:7</A><DD>And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of Jehovah, and forgot Jehovah their God, and served the Baals and the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_jud?n=3:7">Asherahs</A>.
<DT><A NAME="3:8">3:8</A><DD>And the anger of Jehovah was hot against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of Chushan-rishathaim king of <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_jud?n=3:8">Mesopotamia</A>; and the children of Israel served Chushan-rishathaim eight years.
<DT><A NAME="3:9">3:9</A><DD>And the children of Israel cried to Jehovah; and Jehovah raised up a saviour to the children of Israel, who saved them, Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother.
<DT><A NAME="3:10">3:10</A><DD>And the Spirit of Jehovah was upon him, and he judged Israel; and he went out to war, and Jehovah gave Chushan-rishathaim king of Syria into his hand; and his hand prevailed against Chushan-rishathaim.
<DT><A NAME="3:11">3:11</A><DD>And the land had rest forty years; and Othniel the son of Kenaz died.
<DT><A NAME="3:12">3:12</A><DD>And the children of Israel again did evil in the sight of Jehovah; and Jehovah strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel, because they did evil in the sight of Jehovah.
<DT><A NAME="3:13">3:13</A><DD>And he gathered to him the children of Ammon and Amalek and went and smote Israel, and they took possession of the city of palm-trees.
<DT><A NAME="3:14">3:14</A><DD>And the children of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years.
<DT><A NAME="3:15">3:15</A><DD>And the children of Israel cried to Jehovah, and Jehovah raised them up a saviour, Ehud the son of Gera, the Benjaminite, a man <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_jud?n=3:15">left-handed</A>. And by <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_jud?n=3:15a">him</A> the children of Israel sent a gift to Eglon king of Moab.
<DT><A NAME="3:16">3:16</A><DD>And Ehud made him a sword having two edges, it was of a <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_jud?n=3:16">cubit</A> length; and he girded it under his raiment upon his right hip.
<DT><A NAME="3:17">3:17</A><DD>And he brought the gift to Eglon king of Moab; now Eglon was a very fat man.
<DT><A NAME="3:18">3:18</A><DD>And it came to pass when he had ended offering the gift, he sent away the people that had borne the gift.
<DT><A NAME="3:19">3:19</A><DD>But he turned from the graven <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_jud?n=3:19">images</A> that were by Gilgal, and said, I have a secret word unto thee, O king. And he said, Be silent! And all that stood by him went out from him.
<DT><A NAME="3:20">3:20</A><DD>And Ehud came to him; now he was sitting in the cool upper-chamber, which was for him alone. And Ehud said, I have a word from God unto thee. And he arose from the seat.
<DT><A NAME="3:21">3:21</A><DD>Then Ehud put forth his left hand, and took the sword from his right hip, and thrust it into his belly;
<DT><A NAME="3:22">3:22</A><DD>and the haft also went in after the blade, and the fat closed upon the blade; for he did not draw the sword out of his belly, and it came out between the legs.
<DT><A NAME="3:23">3:23</A><DD>And Ehud went out into the portico, and shut the doors of the upper-chamber upon him, and bolted them.
<DT><A NAME="3:24">3:24</A><DD>And when he was gone out, the servants of the <I>king</I> came and saw, and behold, the doors of the upper-chamber were bolted. And they said, Surely he is covering his feet in the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_jud?n=3:24">summer</A> chamber.
<DT><A NAME="3:25">3:25</A><DD>And they waited till they were ashamed; and behold, he opened not the doors of the upper-chamber, and they took the key, and opened <I>them</I>, and behold, their lord lay dead on the earth.
<DT><A NAME="3:26">3:26</A><DD>And Ehud had escaped while they lingered, and passed beyond the graven <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_jud?n=3:26">images</A>, and escaped to Seirah.
<DT><A NAME="3:27">3:27</A><DD>And it came to pass when he was come, that he blew a trumpet in the hill-country of Ephraim, and the children of Israel went down with him from the hill-country, and he before them.
<DT><A NAME="3:28">3:28</A><DD>And he said to them, Follow after me, for Jehovah has delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand. And they went down after him, and took the fords of the Jordan toward Moab, and suffered no one to pass over.
<DT><A NAME="3:29">3:29</A><DD>And they slew the Moabites at that time, about ten thousand men, all fat, and all men of valour, and not a man escaped.
<DT><A NAME="3:30">3:30</A><DD>And Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. And the land had rest eighty years.
<DT><A NAME="3:31">3:31</A><DD>And after him was Shamgar the son of Anath; and he smote the Philistines, six hundred men, with an ox-goad. And he also delivered Israel.
</DL></DIV><H2>Chapter 4</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="4:1">4:1</A><DD>And the children of Israel again did evil in the sight of Jehovah; now Ehud was dead.
<DT><A NAME="4:2">4:2</A><DD>And Jehovah sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan, who reigned in Hazor; and the captain of his army was Sisera, who dwelt in <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_jud?n=4:2">Harosheth-Goim</A>.
<DT><A NAME="4:3">4:3</A><DD>And the children of Israel cried to Jehovah; for he had nine hundred chariots of iron, and he mightily oppressed the children of Israel twenty years.
<DT><A NAME="4:4">4:4</A><DD>And Deborah, a <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_jud?n=4:4">prophetess</A>, the wife of Lapidoth, judged Israel at that time.
<DT><A NAME="4:5">4:5</A><DD>And she dwelt under the palm-tree of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in mount Ephraim; and the children of Israel came up to her for judgment.
<DT><A NAME="4:6">4:6</A><DD>And she sent and called Barak the son of Abinoam out of Kedesh-Naphtali, and said to him, Hath not Jehovah the God of Israel commanded? Go and draw towards mount Tabor, and take with thee ten thousand men of the children of Naphtali and of the children of Zebulun,
<DT><A NAME="4:7">4:7</A><DD>and I will draw unto thee, to the torrent Kishon, Sisera, the captain of Jabin's army, and his chariots and his multitude, and I will give him into thy hand.
<DT><A NAME="4:8">4:8</A><DD>And Barak said to her, If thou goest with me, then I will go, but if thou goest not with me, I will not go.

<DT><A NAME="20:24">20:24</A><DD>And the children of Israel came near against the children of Benjamin the second day.
<DT><A NAME="20:25">20:25</A><DD>And Benjamin went forth against them out of Gibeah the second day, and again destroyed to the ground of the children of Israel eighteen thousand men: all these drew the sword.
<DT><A NAME="20:26">20:26</A><DD>Then all the children of Israel, and all the people, went up and came to Bethel, and wept, and abode there before Jehovah, and fasted that day until even, and offered up burnt-offerings and peace-offerings before Jehovah.
<DT><A NAME="20:27">20:27</A><DD>And the children of Israel inquired of Jehovah (and the ark of the covenant of God was there in those days,
<DT><A NAME="20:28">20:28</A><DD>and Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, stood before <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_jud?n=20:28">it</A> in those days), saying, Shall I yet again go out to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother, or shall I cease? And Jehovah said, Go up; for to-morrow I will give them into thy hand.
<DT><A NAME="20:29">20:29</A><DD>And Israel set liers in wait against Gibeah, round about.
<DT><A NAME="20:30">20:30</A><DD>And the children of Israel went up against the children of Benjamin on the third day, and put themselves in array against Gibeah, as at the other times.
<DT><A NAME="20:31">20:31</A><DD>And the children of Benjamin went out against the people, and were drawn away from the city, and began to smite of the people, slaying as at the former times, in the highways, of which one leads to Bethel and the other to Gibeah <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_jud?n=20:31">in</A> the field, about thirty men of Israel.
<DT><A NAME="20:32">20:32</A><DD>And the children of Benjamin said, They are smitten down before us, as at the first. And the children of Israel said, Let us flee, that we may draw them from the city to the highways.
<DT><A NAME="20:33">20:33</A><DD>And all the men of Israel rose up out of their place, and put themselves in array at Baal-Tamar; and the ambush of Israel rushed forth out of their place, out of the meadows of Geba.
<DT><A NAME="20:34">20:34</A><DD>And there came from opposite Gibeah ten thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and the battle was severe; but they knew not that disaster was coming upon them.
<DT><A NAME="20:35">20:35</A><DD>And Jehovah smote Benjamin before Israel; and the children of Israel destroyed of the Benjaminites that day twenty-five thousand one hundred men: all these drew the sword.
<DT><A NAME="20:36">20:36</A><DD>And the children of Benjamin saw that they were smitten. -- And the men of Israel gave place to Benjamin, because they trusted to the ambush that they had set against Gibeah.
<DT><A NAME="20:37">20:37</A><DD>And the ambush hasted, and fell upon Gibeah; and the ambush drew along, and smote the whole city with the edge of the sword.
<DT><A NAME="20:38">20:38</A><DD>Now there was an appointed sign between the men of Israel and the ambush, that they should make a thick column of smoke rise up out of the city.
<DT><A NAME="20:39">20:39</A><DD>And when the men of Israel turned back in the battle, Benjamin began to smite, slaying of the men of Israel about thirty men; for they said, Surely they are quite routed before us as in the first battle.
<DT><A NAME="20:40">20:40</A><DD>And when the burning began to rise up out of the city as a pillar of smoke, Benjamin looked behind, and behold, the whole city ascended <I>in smoke</I> to the heavens.
<DT><A NAME="20:41">20:41</A><DD>Then the men of Israel turned back, and the men of Benjamin were amazed, for they saw that disaster was come upon them.
<DT><A NAME="20:42">20:42</A><DD>And they turned before the men of Israel to the way of the wilderness; but the battle overtook them; and those who came out of the cities destroyed them in their midst.
<DT><A NAME="20:43">20:43</A><DD>They encompassed the Benjaminites, chased them, trode them down at the resting-place over against Gibeah toward the sun-rising.
<DT><A NAME="20:44">20:44</A><DD>And there fell of Benjamin eighteen thousand men: all these, men of valour.
<DT><A NAME="20:45">20:45</A><DD>And they turned and fled towards the wilderness to the cliff of Rimmon, and they gleaned of them in the highways five thousand men; and pursued hard after them to Gidom, and slew two thousand men of them.
<DT><A NAME="20:46">20:46</A><DD>So that all who fell that day of Benjamin were twenty-five thousand men that drew the sword: all these, men of valour.
<DT><A NAME="20:47">20:47</A><DD>And six hundred men turned and fled to the wilderness to the cliff of Rimmon, and abode at the cliff of Rimmon four months.
<DT><A NAME="20:48">20:48</A><DD>And the men of Israel turned again upon the children of Benjamin, and smote them with the edge of the sword, as well the men of <I>every</I> city as the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_jud?n=20:48">cattle</A>, and all that was found; even all the cities that were found did they set on fire.

<DT><A NAME="21:1">21:1</A><DD>Now the men of Israel had sworn in Mizpah, saying, There shall not any of us give his daughter to the Benjaminites as wife.
<DT><A NAME="21:2">21:2</A><DD>And the people came to Bethel, and abode there till even before God, and lifted up their voices and wept bitterly,
<DT><A NAME="21:3">21:3</A><DD>and said, Jehovah, God of Israel, why is it come to pass in Israel, that there should be this day one tribe lacking in Israel?
<DT><A NAME="21:4">21:4</A><DD>And it came to pass on the morrow, that the people rose early, and built there an altar, and offered up burnt-offerings and peace-offerings.
<DT><A NAME="21:5">21:5</A><DD>And the children of Israel said, Who is there among all the tribes of Israel that came not up with the congregation to Jehovah? For they had <I>made</I> a great <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_jud?n=21:5">oath</A> concerning him that came not up to Jehovah to Mizpah, saying, He shall certainly be put to death.
<DT><A NAME="21:6">21:6</A><DD>And the children of Israel repented them for Benjamin their brother, and said, To-day is one tribe extirpated from Israel.
<DT><A NAME="21:7">21:7</A><DD>What shall we do for wives for them that remain? since we have sworn by Jehovah that we will not give them of our daughters for wives.
<DT><A NAME="21:8">21:8</A><DD>And they said, What one is there of the tribes of Israel that came not up to Mizpah to Jehovah? And behold, there came none to the camp from Jabesh-Gilead, to the congregation;
<DT><A NAME="21:9">21:9</A><DD>for the people were numbered, and behold, there were none of the inhabitants of Jabesh-Gilead there.
<DT><A NAME="21:10">21:10</A><DD>And the assembly sent thither twelve thousand men of the most valiant and commanded them, saying, Go and smite the inhabitants of Jabesh-Gilead with the edge of the sword, and the women and the children.
<DT><A NAME="21:11">21:11</A><DD>And this is the thing which ye shall do: ye shall utterly destroy every male, and every woman that hath lain with man.
<DT><A NAME="21:12">21:12</A><DD>And they found among the inhabitants of Jabesh-Gilead four hundred young women that were virgins, who had known no man by lying with any male, and they brought them to the camp, to Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan.
<DT><A NAME="21:13">21:13</A><DD>And the whole assembly sent to speak to the children of Benjamin that were at the cliff of Rimmon, and to proclaim peace to them.
<DT><A NAME="21:14">21:14</A><DD>And Benjamin came again at that time; and they gave them the wives whom they had saved alive of the women of Jabesh-Gilead; but even so they found not enough for them.
<DT><A NAME="21:15">21:15</A><DD>And the people repented them for Benjamin, because Jehovah had made a breach in the tribes of Israel.
<DT><A NAME="21:16">21:16</A><DD>And the elders of the assembly said, What shall we do for wives for them that remain? for the women have been destroyed out of Benjamin.
<DT><A NAME="21:17">21:17</A><DD>And they said, There must be a possession for those of Benjamin that have escaped, that a tribe be not blotted out of Israel.
<DT><A NAME="21:18">21:18</A><DD>But we cannot give them wives of our daughters, for the children of Israel have sworn, saying, Cursed be he that giveth a wife to the Benjaminites!
<DT><A NAME="21:19">21:19</A><DD>And they said, Behold, there is a feast of Jehovah from year to year in Shiloh, which is on the north side of Bethel, toward the sun-rising of the highway that goes up from Bethel to Shechem, and on the south of Lebonah.
<DT><A NAME="21:20">21:20</A><DD>And they commanded the sons of Benjamin, saying, Go and lie in wait in the vineyards;
<DT><A NAME="21:21">21:21</A><DD>and see, and behold, if the daughters of Shiloh come out to dance in the dances, then come out of the vineyards, and catch you every man his wife of the daughters of Shiloh, and go to the land of Benjamin.
<DT><A NAME="21:22">21:22</A><DD>And it shall be, when their fathers or their brethren come to complain to us, that we will say to them, Gratify us with them, because we did not take each man his wife in the war; for ye did not give them to them, that ye should now be guilty.
<DT><A NAME="21:23">21:23</A><DD>And the children of Benjamin did so, and took wives, according to their number, of them that danced, whom they caught; and they went and returned to their inheritance, and built the cities, and dwelt in them.
<DT><A NAME="21:24">21:24</A><DD>And the children of Israel departed thence at that time, every man to his tribe and to his family, and they went out from thence every man to his inheritance.
<DT><A NAME="21:25">21:25</A><DD>In those days there was no king in Israel; every man did what was right in his own eyes.
