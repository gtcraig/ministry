<DT><A NAME="1:18">1:18</A><DD>Now the birth of Jesus Christ was thus: His mother, Mary, that <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mt?n=1:18">is</A>, having been betrothed to Joseph, before they came together, she was found to be with child of <I>the</I> Holy Spirit.

<DT><A NAME="1:20">1:20</A><DD>but while he pondered on these things, behold, an angel of <I>the</I> <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mt?n=1:20">Lord</A> appeared to him in a dream, saying, Joseph, son of David, fear not to take to <I>thee</I> Mary, thy wife, for that which is begotten in her is of <I>the</I> Holy Spirit.
<DT><A NAME="1:21">1:21</A><DD>And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mt?n=1:21">Jesus</A>, for *he* shall save his people from their sins.
<DT><A NAME="1:22">1:22</A><DD>Now all this came to pass that that might be fulfilled which was spoken by <I>the</I> <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mt?n=1:22">Lord</A>, <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mt?n=1:22a">through</A> the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mt?n=1:22b">prophet</A>, saying,

<DT><A NAME="1:24">1:24</A><DD>But Joseph, having awoke up from his sleep, did as the angel of <I>the</I> <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mt?n=1:24">Lord</A> had enjoined him, and took to <I>him</I> his wife,

<DT><A NAME="2:1">2:1</A><DD>Now Jesus having been <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mt?n=2:1">born</A> in Bethlehem of Judaea, in the days of Herod the king, behold magi from the east arrived at Jerusalem,
<DT><A NAME="2:2">2:2</A><DD>saying, where is the king of the Jews that has been born? for we have seen his star in the east, and have come to do him homage.
<DT><A NAME="2:3">2:3</A><DD>But Herod the king having heard <I>of it</I>, was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him;
<DT><A NAME="2:4">2:4</A><DD>and, assembling all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he inquired of them where the Christ should be born.
<DT><A NAME="2:5">2:5</A><DD>And they said to him, In Bethlehem of Judaea; for thus it is written <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mt?n=2:5">through</A> the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mt?n=2:5a">prophet</A>:
<DT><A NAME="2:6">2:6</A><DD>And *thou* Bethlehem, land of Juda, art in no wise the least among the governors of Juda; for out of thee shall go forth a leader <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mt?n=2:6">who</A> shall shepherd my people Israel.
<DT><A NAME="2:7">2:7</A><DD>Then Herod, having secretly called the magi, <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mt?n=2:7">inquired</A> of them accurately the time of the star that was <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mt?n=2:7a">appearing</A>;
<DT><A NAME="2:8">2:8</A><DD>and having sent them to Bethlehem, said, Go, search out accurately concerning the child, and when ye shall have found <I>him</I> bring me back word, so that *I* also may come and do him homage.
<DT><A NAME="2:9">2:9</A><DD>And they having heard the king went their way; and lo, the star, which they had seen in the east, went before them until it came and stood over the place where the little child was.
<DT><A NAME="2:10">2:10</A><DD>And when they saw the star they rejoiced with exceeding great joy.
<DT><A NAME="2:11">2:11</A><DD>And having come into the house they saw the little child with Mary his mother, and falling down did him homage. And having opened their treasures, they offered to him gifts, gold, and frankincense, and myrrh.
<DT><A NAME="2:12">2:12</A><DD>And being divinely <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mt?n=2:12">instructed</A> in a dream not to return to Herod, they departed into their own country another way.
<DT><A NAME="2:13">2:13</A><DD>Now, they having departed, behold, an angel of <I>the</I> <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mt?n=1:24">Lord</A> appears in a dream to Joseph, saying, Arise, take to <I>thee</I> the little child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and be there until I shall tell thee; for Herod will seek the little child to destroy it.
<DT><A NAME="2:14">2:14</A><DD>And, having arisen, he took to <I>him</I> the little child and his mother by night, and departed into Egypt.
<DT><A NAME="2:15">2:15</A><DD>And he was there until the death of Herod, that that might be fulfilled which was spoken by <I>the</I> <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mt?n=1:24">Lord</A> through the prophet, <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mt?n=2:15">saying</A>, Out of Egypt have I called my son.
<DT><A NAME="2:16">2:16</A><DD>Then Herod, seeing that he had been mocked by the magi, was greatly enraged; and sent and slew all the boys which <I>were</I> in Bethlehem, and in all its borders, from two years and under, according to the time which he had accurately inquired from the magi.
<DT><A NAME="2:17">2:17</A><DD>Then was fulfilled that which was spoken <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mt?n=2:17">through</A> Jeremias the prophet, saying,
<DT><A NAME="2:18">2:18</A><DD>A voice has been heard in Rama, weeping, and great lamentation: Rachel weeping <I>for</I> her children, and would not be comforted, because they are not.
<DT><A NAME="2:19">2:19</A><DD>But Herod having died, behold, an angel of <I>the</I> Lord appears in a dream to Joseph in Egypt,
<DT><A NAME="2:20">2:20</A><DD>saying, arise, take to <I>thee</I> the little child and its mother, and go into the land of Israel: for they who <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mt?n=2:20">sought</A> the life of the little child are dead.
<DT><A NAME="2:21">2:21</A><DD>And he arose and took to <I>him</I> the little child and its mother, and came into the land of Israel;
<DT><A NAME="2:22">2:22</A><DD>but having heard that 'Archelaus reigns over Judaea, instead of Herod his father,' he was afraid to go there; and having been divinely instructed in a dream, he went away into the parts of Galilee,
<DT><A NAME="2:23">2:23</A><DD>and came and dwelt in a town called Nazareth; so <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mt?n=2:23">that</A> that should be fulfilled which was spoken <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mt?n=2:17">through</A> the prophets, He shall be called a <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mt?n=2:23a">Nazaraean</A>.

<DT><A NAME="3:1">3:1</A><DD>Now in those days comes John the baptist, preaching in the wilderness of <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mt?n=3:1">Judaea</A>,
<DT><A NAME="3:2">3:2</A><DD>and saying, Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn nigh.
<DT><A NAME="3:3">3:3</A><DD>For this is he who has been spoken of through Esaias the prophet, <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mt?n=3:3">saying</A>, Voice of him that crieth in the wilderness: prepare ye the way of <I>the</I> <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mt?n=3:3a">Lord</A>, make straight his paths.
<DT><A NAME="3:4">3:4</A><DD>And John himself had his garment of camel's hair, and a leathern girdle about his loins, and his nourishment was locusts and wild honey.
<DT><A NAME="3:5">3:5</A><DD>Then went out to him Jerusalem, and all Judaea, and all the country round the Jordan,
<DT><A NAME="3:6">3:6</A><DD>and were baptised by him in the Jordan, confessing their sins.
<DT><A NAME="3:7">3:7</A><DD>But seeing many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his baptism, he said to them, Offspring of vipers, who has <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mt?n=3:7">forewarned</A> you to flee from the coming wrath?
<DT><A NAME="3:8">3:8</A><DD><A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mt?n=3:8">Produce</A> therefore fruit worthy of <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mt?n=3:8a">repentance</A>.
<DT><A NAME="3:9">3:9</A><DD>And do not think to say within yourselves, We have Abraham for <I>our</I> father; for I say unto you, that God is able of these stones to raise up children to Abraham.
<DT><A NAME="3:10">3:10</A><DD>And already the axe is applied <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mt?n=3:10">to</A> the root of the trees; every tree therefore not <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mt?n=3:10a">producing</A> good fruit is cut down and cast into the fire.
<DT><A NAME="3:11">3:11</A><DD>*I* indeed baptise you with water to repentance, but he that comes after me is mightier than I, whose <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mt?n=3:11">sandals</A> I am not fit to bear; *he* shall baptise you <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mt?n=3:11a">with</A> <I>the</I> Holy Spirit and fire;

<DT><A NAME="3:13">3:13</A><DD>Then comes Jesus from Galilee to the Jordan to John, to be baptised of him;
<DT><A NAME="3:14">3:14</A><DD>but John urgently <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mt?n=3:14">forbad</A> him, saying, *I* have need to be <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mt?n=3:14a">baptised</A> of thee; and comest *thou* to me?
<DT><A NAME="3:15">3:15</A><DD>But Jesus answering said to him, <FONT CLASS=r>Suffer <I>it</I> now; for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness.</FONT> Then he suffers him.
<DT><A NAME="3:16">3:16</A><DD>And Jesus, having been baptised, went up straightway from the water, and lo, the heavens were opened to him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending as a dove, and coming upon him:
<DT><A NAME="3:17">3:17</A><DD>and behold, a voice out of the heavens saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I have found my delight.
</DL></DIV><H2>Chapter 4</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="4:1">4:1</A><DD>Then Jesus was carried up into the wilderness by the Spirit to be tempted of the devil:
<DT><A NAME="4:2">4:2</A><DD>and having fasted forty days and forty nights, afterwards he hungered.
<DT><A NAME="4:3">4:3</A><DD>And the tempter coming up to him said, If thou be Son of God, speak, that these stones may become loaves of bread.
<DT><A NAME="4:4">4:4</A><DD>But he answering said, <FONT CLASS=r>It is <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mt?n=4:4">written</A>, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word which goes out through God's mouth.</FONT>
<DT><A NAME="4:5">4:5</A><DD>Then the devil takes him to the holy city, and sets him upon the edge of the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mt?n=4:5">temple</A>,
<DT><A NAME="4:6">4:6</A><DD>and says to him, If thou be Son of God cast thyself down; for it is <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mt?n=4:6">written</A>, He shall give charge to his angels concerning thee, and on <I>their</I> hands shall they bear thee, lest in anywise thou strike thy foot against a stone.
<DT><A NAME="4:7">4:7</A><DD>Jesus said to him, <FONT CLASS=r>It is again <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mt?n=4:7">written</A>, Thou shalt not tempt <I>the</I> <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mt?n=4:7a">Lord</A> thy God.</FONT>
<DT><A NAME="4:8">4:8</A><DD>Again the devil takes him to a very high mountain, and shews him all the kingdoms of the world, and their glory,

<DT><A NAME="4:10">4:10</A><DD>Then says Jesus to him, <FONT CLASS=r>Get thee away, Satan, for it is <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mt?n=4:10">written</A>, Thou shalt do <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mt?n=4:9">homage</A> to <I>the</I> Lord thy God, and him alone shalt thou serve.</FONT>
<DT><A NAME="4:11">4:11</A><DD>Then the devil leaves him, and behold, angels came and <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mt?n=4:11">ministered</A> to him.
<DT><A NAME="4:12">4:12</A><DD>But having heard that John was delivered up, he departed into Galilee:

<DT><A NAME="4:17">4:17</A><DD>From that time began Jesus to preach and to say, <FONT CLASS=r>Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn nigh.</FONT>
<DT><A NAME="4:18">4:18</A><DD>And walking by the sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea, for they were fishers;

<DT><A NAME="26:47">26:47</A><DD>And while he was yet speaking, behold, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great crowd with swords and sticks from the chief priests and elders of the people.
<DT><A NAME="26:48">26:48</A><DD>Now he that delivered him up had given them a sign, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, he it is: seize him.
<DT><A NAME="26:49">26:49</A><DD>And immediately coming up to Jesus he said, Hail, Rabbi, and covered him with <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mt?n=26:49">kisses</A>.
<DT><A NAME="26:50">26:50</A><DD>But Jesus said to him, <FONT CLASS=r><I>My</I> friend, for what purpose art thou come?</FONT> Then coming up they laid hands upon Jesus and seized him.
<DT><A NAME="26:51">26:51</A><DD>And behold, one of those with Jesus stretched out his hand and drew his sword, and smiting the bondman of the high priest took off his ear.
<DT><A NAME="26:52">26:52</A><DD>Then saith Jesus to him, <FONT CLASS=r>Return thy sword to its place; for all who take the sword shall perish by the sword.</FONT>

<DT><A NAME="26:55">26:55</A><DD>In that hour Jesus said to the crowds, <FONT CLASS=r>Are ye come out as against a robber with swords and sticks to take me? I sat daily <I>with you</I> teaching in the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mt?n=26:55">temple</A>, and ye did not seize me.</FONT>

<DT><A NAME="26:57">26:57</A><DD>Now they that had seized Jesus led <I>him</I> away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were assembled.
<DT><A NAME="26:58">26:58</A><DD>And Peter followed him at a distance, even to the palace of the high priest, and entering in sat with the officers to see the end.
<DT><A NAME="26:59">26:59</A><DD>And the chief priests and the elders and the whole <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mt?n=26:59">sanhedrim</A> sought false witness against Jesus, so that they might put him to death.
<DT><A NAME="26:60">26:60</A><DD>And they found none, though many false witnesses came forward. But at the last two false witnesses came forward
<DT><A NAME="26:61">26:61</A><DD>and said, *He* said, I am able to destroy the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mt?n=26:61">temple</A> of God, and in three days build it.
<DT><A NAME="26:62">26:62</A><DD>And the high priest standing up said to him, Answerest thou nothing? What do these witness against thee?
<DT><A NAME="26:63">26:63</A><DD>But Jesus was silent. And the high priest answering said to him, I adjure thee by the living God <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mt?n=26:63">that</A> thou tell us if *thou* art the Christ the Son of God.
<DT><A NAME="26:64">26:64</A><DD>Jesus says to him, <FONT CLASS=r>*Thou* hast said. Moreover, I say to you, From henceforth ye shall see the Son of man sitting at the right hand of power, and coming on the clouds of heaven.</FONT>
<DT><A NAME="26:65">26:65</A><DD>Then the high priest rent his clothes, saying, He has blasphemed: what need have we any more of witnesses? behold, now ye have heard the blasphemy.
<DT><A NAME="26:66">26:66</A><DD>What think ye? And they answering said, He is liable to the penalty of death.
<DT><A NAME="26:67">26:67</A><DD>Then they spit in his face, and <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mt?n=26:67">buffeted</A> him, and some struck him with the palms of their hand,
<DT><A NAME="26:68">26:68</A><DD>saying, Prophesy to us, Christ, Who is it who struck thee?
<DT><A NAME="26:69">26:69</A><DD>But Peter sat without in the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mt?n=26:69">palace-court</A>; and a maid came to him, saying, And *thou* wast with Jesus the Galilaean.
<DT><A NAME="26:70">26:70</A><DD>But he denied before all, saying, I do not know what thou sayest.
<DT><A NAME="26:71">26:71</A><DD>And when he had gone out into the entrance, another <I>maid</I> saw him, and says to those there, This <I>man</I> also was with Jesus the Nazaraean.
<DT><A NAME="26:72">26:72</A><DD>And again he denied with an oath: I do not know the man.
<DT><A NAME="26:73">26:73</A><DD>And after a little, those who stood <I>there</I>, coming to <I>him</I>, said to Peter, Truly *thou* too art of them, for also thy speech makes thee manifest.
<DT><A NAME="26:74">26:74</A><DD>Then he began to curse and to swear, I know not the man. And immediately <I>the</I> cock crew.
<DT><A NAME="26:75">26:75</A><DD>And Peter remembered the word of Jesus, who had said <I>to him</I>, Before <I>the</I> cock crow thou shalt deny me thrice. And he went forth without, and wept bitterly.
</DL></DIV><H2>Chapter 27</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="27:1">27:1</A><DD>And when it was morning all the chief priests and the elders of the people took counsel <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mt?n=27:1">against</A> Jesus so that they might put him to death.
<DT><A NAME="27:2">27:2</A><DD>And having bound him they led him away, and delivered him up to Pontius Pilate, the governor.
<DT><A NAME="27:3">27:3</A><DD>Then Judas, who delivered him up, seeing that he had been condemned, filled with remorse, returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and the elders,
<DT><A NAME="27:4">27:4</A><DD>saying, I have sinned <I>in</I> having delivered up guiltless blood. But they said, What is that to us? see *thou* <I>to that</I>.
<DT><A NAME="27:5">27:5</A><DD>And having cast down the pieces of silver in the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mt?n=27:5">temple</A>, he left the place, and went away and hanged himself.
<DT><A NAME="27:6">27:6</A><DD>And the chief priests took the pieces of silver and said, It is not lawful to cast them into the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mt?n=27:6">Corban</A>, since it is <I>the</I> price of blood.
<DT><A NAME="27:7">27:7</A><DD>And having taken counsel, they bought with them the field of the potter for a burying-ground for strangers.
<DT><A NAME="27:8">27:8</A><DD>Wherefore that field has been called Blood-field unto this day.
<DT><A NAME="27:9">27:9</A><DD>Then was fulfilled that which was spoken through Jeremias the prophet, saying, And I <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mt?n=27:9">took</A> the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that was set a price on, whom <I>they who were</I> of the sons of Israel had set a price on,
<DT><A NAME="27:10">27:10</A><DD>and they gave them for the field of the potter, according as <I>the</I> Lord commanded <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mt?n=27:10">me</A>.
<DT><A NAME="27:11">27:11</A><DD>But Jesus stood before the governor. And the governor questioned him, saying, Art *thou* the King of the Jews? And Jesus said to him, <FONT CLASS=r>Thou sayest.</FONT>
<DT><A NAME="27:12">27:12</A><DD>And when he was accused of the chief priests and the elders, he answered nothing.
<DT><A NAME="27:13">27:13</A><DD>Then says Pilate to him, Hearest thou not how many things they witness against thee?
<DT><A NAME="27:14">27:14</A><DD>And he answered him not so much as one word, so that the governor wondered exceedingly.
<DT><A NAME="27:15">27:15</A><DD>Now at <I>the</I> feast the governor was accustomed to release one prisoner to the crowd, whom they would.
<DT><A NAME="27:16">27:16</A><DD>And they had then a notable prisoner, named Barabbas.
<DT><A NAME="27:17">27:17</A><DD>They therefore being gathered together, Pilate said to them, Whom will ye that I release to you, Barabbas, or Jesus who is called Christ?
<DT><A NAME="27:18">27:18</A><DD>For he knew that they had delivered him up through envy.
<DT><A NAME="27:19">27:19</A><DD>But, as he was sitting on the judgment-seat, his wife sent to him, saying, Have thou nothing to do with that righteous <I>man</I>; for I have suffered to-day many things in a dream because of him.
<DT><A NAME="27:20">27:20</A><DD>But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowds that they should beg for Barabbas, and destroy Jesus.
<DT><A NAME="27:21">27:21</A><DD>And the governor answering said to them, Which of the two will ye that I release unto you? And they said, Barabbas.
<DT><A NAME="27:22">27:22</A><DD>Pilate says to them, What then shall I do with Jesus, who is called Christ? They all say, Let him be crucified.
<DT><A NAME="27:23">27:23</A><DD>And the governor said, What evil then has he done? But they cried more than ever, saying, Let him be crucified.
<DT><A NAME="27:24">27:24</A><DD>And Pilate, seeing that it availed nothing, but that rather a tumult was arising, having taken water, washed his hands before the crowd, saying, I am guiltless of the blood of this righteous one: see *ye* <I>to it</I>.
<DT><A NAME="27:25">27:25</A><DD>And all the people answering said, His blood <I>be</I> on us and on our children.
<DT><A NAME="27:26">27:26</A><DD>Then he released to them Barabbas; but Jesus, having scourged <I>him</I>, he delivered up that he might be crucified.
<DT><A NAME="27:27">27:27</A><DD>Then the soldiers of the governor, having taken Jesus with <I>them</I> to the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mt?n=27:27">praetorium</A>, gathered against him the whole <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mt?n=27:27a">band</A>,
<DT><A NAME="27:28">27:28</A><DD>and having taken off his garment, put <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mt?n=27:28">on</A> him a scarlet cloak;
<DT><A NAME="27:29">27:29</A><DD>and having woven a crown out of thorns, they put it on his head, and a reed in his right hand; and, bowing the knee before him, they mocked him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews!
<DT><A NAME="27:30">27:30</A><DD>And having spit upon him, they took the reed and beat <I>him</I> on his head.
<DT><A NAME="27:31">27:31</A><DD>And when they had mocked him, they took the cloak off him, and put his own clothes on him, and led him away to crucify.
<DT><A NAME="27:32">27:32</A><DD>And as they went forth they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name; him they compelled to go <I>with them</I> that he might bear his cross.
<DT><A NAME="27:33">27:33</A><DD>And having come to a place called Golgotha, which <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mt?n=27:33">means</A> Place of a skull,
<DT><A NAME="27:34">27:34</A><DD>they gave to him to drink vinegar mingled with gall; and having tasted <I>it</I>, he would not drink.
<DT><A NAME="27:35">27:35</A><DD>And having crucified him, they parted his clothes amongst <I>themselves</I>, casting <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mt?n=27:35">lots</A>.
<DT><A NAME="27:36">27:36</A><DD>And sitting down, they kept guard over him there.
<DT><A NAME="27:37">27:37</A><DD>And they set up over his head his accusation written: This is Jesus, the King of the Jews.
<DT><A NAME="27:38">27:38</A><DD>Then are crucified with him two robbers, one on the right hand and one on the left.
<DT><A NAME="27:39">27:39</A><DD>But the passers-by reviled him, shaking their heads
<DT><A NAME="27:40">27:40</A><DD>and saying, Thou that destroyest the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mt?n=27:40">temple</A> and buildest it in three days, save thyself. If thou art Son of God, descend from the cross.
<DT><A NAME="27:41">27:41</A><DD><I>And</I> in like manner the chief priests also, mocking, with the scribes and elders, said,
<DT><A NAME="27:42">27:42</A><DD>He saved others, himself he cannot save. He is King of Israel: let him descend now from the cross, and we will believe on him.
<DT><A NAME="27:43">27:43</A><DD>He trusted upon God; let him save him now if he will <I>have</I> him. For he said, I am Son of God.
<DT><A NAME="27:44">27:44</A><DD>And the robbers also who had been crucified with him cast the same reproaches on him.
<DT><A NAME="27:45">27:45</A><DD>Now from <I>the</I> sixth hour there was darkness over the whole <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mt?n=27:45">land</A> until <I>the</I> ninth hour;
<DT><A NAME="27:46">27:46</A><DD>but about the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mt?n=27:46">saying</A>, <FONT CLASS=r>Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?</FONT> that is, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?
<DT><A NAME="27:47">27:47</A><DD>And some of those who stood there, when they heard <I>it</I>, said, This <I>man</I> calls for Elias.
<DT><A NAME="27:48">27:48</A><DD>And immediately one of them running and getting a sponge, having filled <I>it</I> with vinegar and fixed <I>it</I> on a reed, gave him to drink.
<DT><A NAME="27:49">27:49</A><DD>But the rest said, Let be; let us see if Elias comes to save him.
<DT><A NAME="27:50">27:50</A><DD>And Jesus, having again cried with a loud voice, gave up the ghost.
<DT><A NAME="27:51">27:51</A><DD>And lo, the veil of the temple was rent in two from the top to the bottom, and the earth was shaken, and the rocks were rent,
<DT><A NAME="27:52">27:52</A><DD>and the tombs were opened; and many bodies of the saints fallen asleep arose,
<DT><A NAME="27:53">27:53</A><DD>and going out of the tombs after his arising, entered into the holy city and appeared unto many.
<DT><A NAME="27:54">27:54</A><DD>But the centurion, and they who were with him on guard over Jesus, seeing the earthquake and the things that took place, feared greatly, saying, Truly this <I>man</I> was Son of God.
<DT><A NAME="27:55">27:55</A><DD>And there were there many women beholding from afar off, <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mt?n=27:55">who</A> had followed Jesus from Galilee <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mt?n=27:55a">ministering</A> to him,
<DT><A NAME="27:56">27:56</A><DD>among whom was Mary of Magdala, and Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.
<DT><A NAME="27:57">27:57</A><DD>Now when even was come there came a rich man of Arimathaea, his name Joseph, who also himself was a disciple to Jesus.
<DT><A NAME="27:58">27:58</A><DD>*He*, going to Pilate, begged the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded the body to be given up.
<DT><A NAME="27:59">27:59</A><DD>And Joseph having got the body, <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mt?n=27:59">wrapped</A> it in a clean linen cloth,
<DT><A NAME="27:60">27:60</A><DD>and laid it in his new tomb which he had hewn in the rock; and having rolled a great stone to the door of the tomb, went away.
<DT><A NAME="27:61">27:61</A><DD>But Mary of Magdala was there, and the other Mary, sitting opposite the sepulchre.
<DT><A NAME="27:62">27:62</A><DD>Now on the morrow, which is after the preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees came together to Pilate,
<DT><A NAME="27:63">27:63</A><DD>saying, Sir, we have called to mind that that deceiver said when he was still alive, After three days I arise.
<DT><A NAME="27:64">27:64</A><DD>Command therefore that the sepulchre be secured until the third day, <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mt?n=27:64">lest</A> his disciples should come and steal him away, and say to the people, He is risen from the dead; and the last error shall be worse than the first.
<DT><A NAME="27:65">27:65</A><DD>And Pilate said to them, Ye have a watch: go, secure it as well as ye know how.
<DT><A NAME="27:66">27:66</A><DD>And they went and secured the sepulchre, having sealed the stone, with the watch <I>besides</I>.

<DT><A NAME="28:1">28:1</A><DD>Now late on sabbath, as it was the dusk of the next day after <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mt?n=28:1">sabbath</A>, came Mary of Magdala and the other Mary to look at the sepulchre.
<DT><A NAME="28:2">28:2</A><DD>And behold, there was a great earthquake; for an angel of <I>the</I> Lord, descending out of heaven, came and rolled away the stone and sat upon it.
