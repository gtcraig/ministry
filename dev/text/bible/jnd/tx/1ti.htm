<DT><A NAME="1:2">1:2</A><DD>to Timotheus, <I>my</I> true child in faith: grace, mercy, peace, from God <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1ti?n=1:2">our</A> Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.
<DT><A NAME="1:3">1:3</A><DD>Even as I begged thee to remain in Ephesus, <I>when I was</I> going to Macedonia, that thou mightest enjoin some not to teach other doctrines,
<DT><A NAME="1:4">1:4</A><DD>nor to turn their minds to fables and interminable genealogies, <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1ti?n=1:4">which</A> bring questionings rather than <I>further</I> God's <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1ti?n=1:4a">dispensation</A>, which <I>is</I> in faith.
<DT><A NAME="1:5">1:5</A><DD>But the end of what is <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1ti?n=1:5">enjoined</A> is love out of a pure heart and a good conscience and unfeigned <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1ti?n=1:5a">faith</A>;
<DT><A NAME="1:6">1:6</A><DD>which <I>things</I> some having <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1ti?n=1:6">missed</A>, have turned aside to vain discourse,
<DT><A NAME="1:7">1:7</A><DD>desiring to be law-teachers, not understanding either what they say or concerning what they <I>so</I> strenuously affirm.
<DT><A NAME="1:8">1:8</A><DD>Now we know that the law <I>is</I> good if any one uses it lawfully,
<DT><A NAME="1:9">1:9</A><DD>knowing this, that law has not its <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1ti?n=1:9">application</A> to a righteous person, but to <I>the</I> lawless and insubordinate, to <I>the</I> impious and sinful, to <I>the</I> unholy and profane, to smiters of fathers and smiters of mothers; to murderers,
<DT><A NAME="1:10">1:10</A><DD>fornicators, sodomites, kidnappers, liars, perjurers; and if any other thing is opposed to sound teaching,
<DT><A NAME="1:11">1:11</A><DD>according to the glad tidings of the glory of the blessed God, with which *I* have been entrusted.
<DT><A NAME="1:12">1:12</A><DD><I>And</I> I <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1ti?n=1:12">thank</A> Christ Jesus our Lord, who has given me power, that he has counted me faithful, appointing to ministry <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1ti?n=1:12a">him</A>
<DT><A NAME="1:13">1:13</A><DD>who before was a blasphemer and persecutor, and an insolent overbearing <I>man</I>: but mercy was shewn me because I did it ignorantly, in unbelief.
<DT><A NAME="1:14">1:14</A><DD>But the grace of our Lord surpassingly over-abounded with faith and love, which <I>is</I> in Christ Jesus.
<DT><A NAME="1:15">1:15</A><DD>Faithful <I>is</I> the word, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom *I* am <I>the</I> first.
<DT><A NAME="1:16">1:16</A><DD>But for this reason mercy was shewn me, that in me, <I>the</I> first, Jesus Christ might display the whole long-suffering, for a delineation <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1ti?n=1:16">of</A> those about to believe on him to life eternal.
<DT><A NAME="1:17">1:17</A><DD>Now to the King of the ages, <I>the</I> incorruptible, invisible, only God, honour and glory to the ages of ages. Amen.
<DT><A NAME="1:18">1:18</A><DD>This <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1ti?n=1:18">charge</A>, <I>my</I> child Timotheus, I commit to thee, according to the prophecies as to thee preceding, in order <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1ti?n=1:18a">that</A> thou mightest war by them the good warfare,

</DL></DIV><H2>Chapter 2</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="2:1">2:1</A><DD>I exhort therefore, first of all, that supplications, prayers, <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1ti?n=2:1">intercessions</A>, thanksgivings be made for all men;
<DT><A NAME="2:2">2:2</A><DD>for kings and all that are in dignity, that we may lead a quiet and tranquil life in all piety and gravity;
<DT><A NAME="2:3">2:3</A><DD>for this is good and acceptable before our Saviour God,

<DT><A NAME="2:5">2:5</A><DD>For God is one, and <I>the</I> <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1ti?n=2:5">mediator</A> of God and men one, <I>the</I> man Christ Jesus,
<DT><A NAME="2:6">2:6</A><DD>who gave himself a ransom <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1ti?n=2:6">for</A> all, the testimony <I>to be rendered</I> in its own times;
<DT><A NAME="2:7">2:7</A><DD>to which *I* have been appointed a <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1ti?n=2:7">herald</A> and apostle, (I speak <I>the</I> truth, I do not lie,) a teacher of <I>the</I> nations in faith and truth.
<DT><A NAME="2:8">2:8</A><DD>I will therefore that the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1ti?n=2:8">men</A> pray in every place, lifting up <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1ti?n=2:8a">pious</A> hands, without wrath or reasoning.
<DT><A NAME="2:9">2:9</A><DD>In like manner also that the women in decent deportment and <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1ti?n=2:9">dress</A> adorn themselves with modesty and <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1ti?n=2:9a">discretion</A>, not with plaited <I>hair</I> and gold, or pearls, or costly clothing,
<DT><A NAME="2:10">2:10</A><DD>but, what becomes women making profession of the fear of God, by good works.
<DT><A NAME="2:11">2:11</A><DD>Let a woman learn in quietness in all subjection;
<DT><A NAME="2:12">2:12</A><DD>but I do not suffer a woman to teach nor to exercise authority over <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1ti?n=2:12">man</A>, but to be in quietness;
<DT><A NAME="2:13">2:13</A><DD>for Adam was formed first, then Eve:
<DT><A NAME="2:14">2:14</A><DD>and Adam was not deceived; but the woman, having been <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1ti?n=2:14">deceived</A>, was in transgression.
<DT><A NAME="2:15">2:15</A><DD>But she shall be preserved in childbearing, if they continue in faith and love and <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1ti?n=2:15">holiness</A> with discretion.
</DL></DIV><H2>Chapter 3</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="3:1">3:1</A><DD>The word <I>is</I> faithful: if any one aspires to exercise oversight, he desires a good work.
<DT><A NAME="3:2">3:2</A><DD>The overseer then must be irreproachable, husband of one wife, sober, <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1ti?n=3:2">discreet</A>, decorous, hospitable, apt to teach;
<DT><A NAME="3:3">3:3</A><DD>not given to excesses from wine, not a striker, but mild, not addicted to contention, not fond of money,
<DT><A NAME="3:4">3:4</A><DD>conducting his own house well, having <I>his</I> children in subjection with all gravity;
<DT><A NAME="3:5">3:5</A><DD>(but if one does not know how to conduct his own house, how shall he take care of the assembly of God?)
<DT><A NAME="3:6">3:6</A><DD>not a novice, that he may not, being inflated, fall into <I>the</I> <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1ti?n=3:6">fault</A> of the devil.
<DT><A NAME="3:7">3:7</A><DD>But it is necessary that he should have also a good testimony from those without, that he may fall not into reproach and <I>the</I> snare of the devil.
<DT><A NAME="3:8">3:8</A><DD><A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1ti?n=3:8">Ministers</A>, in like manner, grave, not double-tongued, not given to much wine, not seeking gain by base means,
<DT><A NAME="3:9">3:9</A><DD>holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience.
<DT><A NAME="3:10">3:10</A><DD>And let these be first proved, then let them <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1ti?n=3:10">minister</A>, being without charge <I>against them</I>.
<DT><A NAME="3:11">3:11</A><DD><I>The</I> women in like manner grave, not slanderers, sober, faithful in all things.

<DT><A NAME="3:14">3:14</A><DD>These things I write to thee, hoping to come to thee more <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1ti?n=3:14">quickly</A>;

<DT><A NAME="3:16">3:16</A><DD>And confessedly the mystery of piety is great. <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1ti?n=3:16">God</A> has been manifested in flesh, has been justified in <I>the</I> Spirit, has appeared <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1ti?n=3:16a">to</A> angels, has been preached among <I>the</I> nations, has been believed on in <I>the</I> world, has been received up in glory.
</DL></DIV><H2>Chapter 4</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="4:1">4:1</A><DD>But the Spirit speaks expressly, that in latter times some shall apostatise from the faith, giving their mind to deceiving spirits and teachings of demons

<DT><A NAME="4:4">4:4</A><DD>For every creature of God <I>is</I> good, and nothing <I>is</I> to be rejected, being received with thanksgiving;

<DT><A NAME="4:6">4:6</A><DD>Laying these things before the brethren, thou wilt be a good <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1ti?n=4:6">minister</A> of Christ Jesus, nourished with the words of the faith and of the good teaching which thou hast fully followed <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1ti?n=4:6a">up</A>.
<DT><A NAME="4:7">4:7</A><DD>But profane and old wives' fables avoid, but exercise thyself unto piety;

</DL></DIV><H2>Chapter 5</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="5:1">5:1</A><DD>Rebuke not an elder sharply, but exhort <I>him</I> as a father, younger <I>men</I> as brethren,

<DT><A NAME="5:3">5:3</A><DD>Honour widows who are really widows;
<DT><A NAME="5:4">5:4</A><DD>but if any widow have children or descendants, let them learn first to be pious as regards their own house, and to render a return on their side to <I>their</I> parents; for this is acceptable in the sight of God.
<DT><A NAME="5:5">5:5</A><DD>Now she who <I>is</I> a widow indeed, and is left alone, has put <I>her</I> hope in God, and continues in supplications and prayers night and day.
<DT><A NAME="5:6">5:6</A><DD>But she that lives in habits of self-indulgence is dead <I>while</I> living.
<DT><A NAME="5:7">5:7</A><DD>And these things enjoin, that they may be irreproachable.
<DT><A NAME="5:8">5:8</A><DD>But if any one does not provide for his own, and specially for those of <I>his</I> house, he has denied the faith, and is worse than the unbeliever.

<DT><A NAME="5:11">5:11</A><DD>But younger widows decline; for when they grow wanton against Christ, they desire to marry,
<DT><A NAME="5:12">5:12</A><DD>being guilty, because they have cast off their first faith.
