<H2>Chapter 1</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="1:1">1:1</A><DD>And Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab.
<DT><A NAME="1:2">1:2</A><DD>And Ahaziah fell down through the lattice in his upper chamber which was in Samaria, and was sick; and he sent messengers and said to them, Go, inquire of Baal-zebub the god of Ekron, whether I shall recover from this disease.
<DT><A NAME="1:3">1:3</A><DD>And the angel of Jehovah said to Elijah the Tishbite, Arise, go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria, and say to them, Is it because there is not a God in Israel, that ye go to inquire of Baal-zebub the god of Ekron?
<DT><A NAME="1:4">1:4</A><DD>Now therefore thus saith Jehovah: Thou shalt not come down from the bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt certainly die. And Elijah departed.
<DT><A NAME="1:5">1:5</A><DD>And the messengers returned to him; and he said to them, Why have ye returned?
<DT><A NAME="1:6">1:6</A><DD>And they said unto him, A man came up to meet us, and said to us, Go, return to the king that sent you and say to him, Thus saith Jehovah: Is it because there is not a God in Israel, that thou sendest to inquire of Baal-zebub the god of Ekron? therefore thou shalt not come down from the bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt certainly die.
<DT><A NAME="1:7">1:7</A><DD>And he said to them, What manner of man was he that came up to meet you, and told you these words?
<DT><A NAME="1:8">1:8</A><DD>And they said to him, He was a man in a hairy <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2ki?n=1:8"><I>garment</I></A>, and girt with a girdle of leather about his loins. And he said, It is Elijah the Tishbite.
<DT><A NAME="1:9">1:9</A><DD>And he sent to him a captain of fifty with his fifty. And he went up to him, and behold, he sat on the top of the mount. And he spoke to him: Man of God, the king says, Come down!
<DT><A NAME="1:10">1:10</A><DD>And Elijah answered and said to the captain of fifty, And if I be a man of God, let fire come down from the heavens and consume thee and thy fifty. And there came down fire from the heavens, and consumed him and his fifty.
<DT><A NAME="1:11">1:11</A><DD>And again he sent to him another captain of fifty with his fifty. And he spoke and said to him, Man of God, thus says the king: Come down quickly!
<DT><A NAME="1:12">1:12</A><DD>And Elijah answered and said to them, If I be a man of God, let fire come down from the heavens and consume thee and thy fifty. And the fire of God came down from the heavens, and consumed him and his fifty.
<DT><A NAME="1:13">1:13</A><DD>And again he sent the captain of a third fifty with his fifty. And the third captain of fifty went up, and came and fell on his knees before Elijah, and besought him and said to him, Man of God, I pray thee, let my <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2ki?n=1:13">life</A>, and the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2ki?n=1:13">life</A> of these fifty thy servants, be precious in thy sight.
<DT><A NAME="1:14">1:14</A><DD>Behold, there came down fire from the heavens, and consumed the two captains of the former fifties with their fifties; but now, let my life be precious in thy sight.
<DT><A NAME="1:15">1:15</A><DD>And the angel of Jehovah said to Elijah, Go down with him: be not afraid of him. And he arose, and went down with him to the king.
<DT><A NAME="1:16">1:16</A><DD>And he said to him, Thus saith Jehovah: Forasmuch as thou hast sent messengers to inquire of Baal-zebub the god of Ekron, is it because there is no God in Israel to inquire of his word? therefore thou shalt not come down from the bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt certainly die.
<DT><A NAME="1:17">1:17</A><DD>And he died according to the word of Jehovah that Elijah had spoken. And Jehoram began to reign in his stead, in the second year of Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah; for he had no son.
<DT><A NAME="1:18">1:18</A><DD>And the rest of the acts of Ahaziah, what he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
</DL></DIV><H2>Chapter 2</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="2:1">2:1</A><DD>And it came to pass when Jehovah would take up Elijah into the heavens by a whirlwind, that Elijah went with Elisha from Gilgal.
<DT><A NAME="2:2">2:2</A><DD>And Elijah said to Elisha, Abide here, I pray thee; for Jehovah has sent me to Bethel. And Elisha said, As Jehovah liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee! So they went down to Bethel.
<DT><A NAME="2:3">2:3</A><DD>And the sons of the prophets that were at Bethel came forth to Elisha, and said to him, Dost thou know that Jehovah will take away thy master from over thy head to-day? And he said, I also know it: be silent!
<DT><A NAME="2:4">2:4</A><DD>And Elijah said to him, Elisha, abide here, I pray thee; for Jehovah has sent me to Jericho. And he said, As Jehovah liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee! And they came to Jericho.
<DT><A NAME="2:5">2:5</A><DD>And the sons of the prophets that were at Jericho drew near to Elisha and said to him, Dost thou know that Jehovah will take away thy master from over thy head to-day? And he said, I also know it: be silent!
<DT><A NAME="2:6">2:6</A><DD>And Elijah said to him, Abide here, I pray thee; for Jehovah has sent me to the Jordan. And he said, As Jehovah liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee! And they two went on.
<DT><A NAME="2:7">2:7</A><DD>And fifty men of the sons of the prophets went and stood opposite afar off; and they two stood by the Jordan.
<DT><A NAME="2:8">2:8</A><DD>And Elijah took his mantle, and wrapped it together, and smote the waters, and they were divided hither and thither; and they two went over on dry ground.
<DT><A NAME="2:9">2:9</A><DD>And it came to pass when they had gone over, that Elijah said to Elisha, Ask what I shall do for thee, before I am taken away from thee. And Elisha said, I pray thee, let a double portion of thy spirit be upon me.
<DT><A NAME="2:10">2:10</A><DD>And he said, Thou hast asked a hard thing: if thou see me when I am taken from thee, it shall be so to thee; but if not, it shall not be <I>so</I>.
<DT><A NAME="2:11">2:11</A><DD>And it came to pass as they went on, and talked, that behold, a chariot of fire and horses of fire; and they parted them both asunder; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into the heavens.
<DT><A NAME="2:12">2:12</A><DD>And Elisha saw <I>it</I>, and he cried, My father, my father! the chariot of Israel and the horsemen thereof! And he saw him no more. Then he took hold of his own garments and rent them in two pieces.
<DT><A NAME="2:13">2:13</A><DD>And he took up the mantle of Elijah which fell from him, and went back and stood by the bank of the Jordan;
<DT><A NAME="2:14">2:14</A><DD>and he took the mantle of Elijah which had fallen from him, and smote the waters, and said, Where is Jehovah, the God of Elijah? He <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2ki?n=2:14">also</A> smote the waters, and they parted hither and thither, and Elisha went over.
<DT><A NAME="2:15">2:15</A><DD>And the sons of the prophets who were at Jericho on the opposite side saw him, and they said, The spirit of Elijah rests on Elisha. And they came to meet him, and bowed themselves to the ground before him,
<DT><A NAME="2:16">2:16</A><DD>and said to him, Behold now, there are with thy servants fifty valiant men; let them go, we pray thee, and seek thy master, lest perhaps the Spirit of Jehovah have taken him up, and cast him upon some mountain, or into some ravine. And he said, Ye shall not send.
<DT><A NAME="2:17">2:17</A><DD>And they pressed him till he was ashamed, and he said, Send. They sent therefore fifty men, and they sought three days, but did not find him.
<DT><A NAME="2:18">2:18</A><DD>And they came again to him (now he was staying at Jericho); and he said to them, Did I not say to you, Go not?
<DT><A NAME="2:19">2:19</A><DD>And the men of the city said to Elisha, Behold now, the situation of the city is good, as my lord sees; but the water is bad, and the land is barren.
<DT><A NAME="2:20">2:20</A><DD>And he said, Bring me a new cruse, and put salt in it. And they brought it to him.
<DT><A NAME="2:21">2:21</A><DD>And he went forth to the source of the waters, and cast the salt in there, and said, Thus saith Jehovah: I have healed these waters: there shall not be from thence any more death or barrenness.
<DT><A NAME="2:22">2:22</A><DD>And the waters were healed to this day, according to the saying of Elisha which he spoke.
<DT><A NAME="2:23">2:23</A><DD>And he went up from thence to Bethel, and as he went up by the way, there came forth little boys out of the city, and mocked him, and said to him, Go <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2ki?n=2:23">up</A>, bald head; go up, bald head!
<DT><A NAME="2:24">2:24</A><DD>And he turned back, and looked on them, and cursed them in the name of Jehovah. And there came forth two she-bears out of the wood, and tore forty-two children of them.
<DT><A NAME="2:25">2:25</A><DD>And he went from thence to mount Carmel, and from thence he returned to Samaria.
</DL></DIV><H2>Chapter 3</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="3:1">3:1</A><DD>And Jehoram the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria in the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah; and he reigned twelve years.
<DT><A NAME="3:2">3:2</A><DD>And he wrought evil in the sight of Jehovah, but not like his father, and like his mother; and he took away the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2ki?n=3:2">column</A> of Baal that his father had made.
<DT><A NAME="3:3">3:3</A><DD>Only, he clave to the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat who made Israel to sin: he did not depart therefrom.
<DT><A NAME="3:4">3:4</A><DD>And Mesha king of Moab was a sheepmaster, and rendered to the king of Israel a hundred thousand lambs and a hundred thousand rams, with the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2ki?n=3:4">wool</A>.
<DT><A NAME="3:5">3:5</A><DD>And it came to pass when Ahab was dead, that the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel.
<DT><A NAME="3:6">3:6</A><DD>And at that time king Jehoram went out of Samaria and inspected all Israel.
<DT><A NAME="3:7">3:7</A><DD>And he went and sent to Jehoshaphat the king of Judah saying, The king of Moab has rebelled against me: wilt thou go with me against Moab to battle? And he said, I will go up: I am as thou, my people as thy people, my horses as thy horses.
<DT><A NAME="3:8">3:8</A><DD>And he said, Which way shall we go up? And he said, By way of the wilderness of Edom.
<DT><A NAME="3:9">3:9</A><DD>And the king of Israel went, and the king of Judah, and the king of Edom, and they made a circuit of seven days' journey. And there was no water for the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2ki?n=3:9">army</A>, and for the cattle that followed them.
<DT><A NAME="3:10">3:10</A><DD>And the king of Israel said, Alas! that Jehovah has called these three kings together, to give them into the hand of Moab!
<DT><A NAME="3:11">3:11</A><DD>And Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of Jehovah that we may inquire of Jehovah by him? And one of the king of Israel's servants answered and said, Here is Elisha the son of Shaphat, who poured water on the hands of Elijah.
<DT><A NAME="3:12">3:12</A><DD>And Jehoshaphat said, The word of Jehovah is with him. And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him.
<DT><A NAME="3:13">3:13</A><DD>And Elisha said to the king of Israel, What have I to do with thee? go to the prophets of thy father and to the prophets of thy mother. And the king of Israel said to him, Not so, for Jehovah has called these three kings to give them into the hand of Moab.
<DT><A NAME="3:14">3:14</A><DD>And Elisha said, As Jehovah of hosts liveth, before whom I stand, surely, were it not that I regard the presence of Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, I would not look toward thee nor see thee.
<DT><A NAME="3:15">3:15</A><DD>And now fetch me a minstrel. And it came to pass when the minstrel played, that the hand of Jehovah was upon him.
<DT><A NAME="3:16">3:16</A><DD>And he said, Thus saith Jehovah: Make this valley full of <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2ki?n=3:16">ditches</A>.
<DT><A NAME="3:17">3:17</A><DD>For thus saith Jehovah: Ye shall not see wind, neither shall ye see rain; yet this valley shall be filled with water, and ye shall drink, both ye, and your cattle, and your beasts.
<DT><A NAME="3:18">3:18</A><DD>And this is a light thing in the sight of Jehovah: he will give the Moabites also into your hand.
<DT><A NAME="3:19">3:19</A><DD>And ye shall smite every fortified city, and every choice city, and shall fell every good tree, and stop all wells of water, and mar every good piece of land with stones.
<DT><A NAME="3:20">3:20</A><DD>And it came to pass in the morning, when the oblation was <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2ki?n=3:20">offered</A> up, that behold, there came water by the way of Edom, and the country was filled with water.
<DT><A NAME="3:21">3:21</A><DD>And all the Moabites heard that the kings were come up to fight against them, and they were called together, all that were able to put on armour, and upward, and stood by the border.
<DT><A NAME="3:22">3:22</A><DD>And they rose up early in the morning, and the sun rose upon the water, and the Moabites saw the water on the other side red as blood.
<DT><A NAME="3:23">3:23</A><DD>And they said, This is blood: the kings are entirely destroyed, and have smitten one another; and now, Moab, to the spoil!
<DT><A NAME="3:24">3:24</A><DD>And when they came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites rose up and smote the Moabites, and they fled before them; and they entered in and smote Moab.
<DT><A NAME="3:25">3:25</A><DD>And they beat down the cities, and on every good piece of land cast every man his stone and filled it, and they stopped every well of water, and felled every good tree, until they left <I>only</I> <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2ki?n=3:25">the</A> stones at Kirhareseth; and the slingers went about it, and smote it.
<DT><A NAME="3:26">3:26</A><DD>And the king of Moab saw that the battle was too severe for him, and he took with him seven hundred men that drew swords, to break through to the king of Edom, but they could not.
<DT><A NAME="3:27">3:27</A><DD>And he took his eldest son, that should have reigned in his stead, and offered him up for a burnt-offering upon the wall. And there was great wrath against Israel; and they departed from him, and returned to <I>their own</I> land.
</DL></DIV><H2>Chapter 4</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="4:1">4:1</A><DD>And a woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets cried to Elisha saying, Thy servant my husband is dead, and thou knowest that thy servant feared Jehovah; and the creditor is come to take my two children to be bondmen.
<DT><A NAME="4:2">4:2</A><DD>And Elisha said to her, What shall I do for thee? Tell me, what hast thou in the house? And she said, Thy handmaid has not anything at all in the house but a pot of oil.
<DT><A NAME="4:3">4:3</A><DD>And he said, Go, borrow for thyself vessels abroad from all thy neighbours, empty vessels; let it not <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2ki?n=4:3">be</A> few;
<DT><A NAME="4:4">4:4</A><DD>and go in, and shut the door upon thee and upon thy sons, and pour out into all those vessels, and set aside what is full.
<DT><A NAME="4:5">4:5</A><DD>And she went from him, and shut the door upon her and upon her sons: they brought <I>the vessels</I> to her, and she poured out.
<DT><A NAME="4:6">4:6</A><DD>And it came to pass when the vessels were full, that she said to her son, Bring me yet a vessel. And he said to her, There is not a vessel more. And the oil stayed.
<DT><A NAME="4:7">4:7</A><DD>And she came and told the man of God; and he said, Go, sell the oil, and pay thy debt, and live thou <I>and</I> thy sons on the rest.
<DT><A NAME="4:8">4:8</A><DD>And it came to pass on a day, that Elisha passed to Shunem, where was a <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2ki?n=4:8">wealthy</A> woman; and she constrained him to eat bread. And so it was, <I>that</I> as oft as he passed by, he turned in thither to eat bread.
<DT><A NAME="4:9">4:9</A><DD>And she said to her husband, Behold now, I perceive that this is a holy man of God, who passes by us continually.
<DT><A NAME="4:10">4:10</A><DD>Let us make, I pray thee, a small upper chamber with <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2ki?n=4:10">walls</A>, and let us set for him there a bed, and a table, and a seat, and a lampstand; and it shall be when he cometh to us, he shall turn in thither.
<DT><A NAME="4:11">4:11</A><DD>And it came to pass on a day, that he came thither, and he turned into the upper chamber, and lay there.
<DT><A NAME="4:12">4:12</A><DD>And he said to Gehazi his <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2ki?n=4:12">servant</A>, Call this Shunammite. And he called her, and she stood before him.
<DT><A NAME="4:13">4:13</A><DD>And he said to him, Say now to her, Behold, thou hast been careful for us with all this <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2ki?n=4:13">care</A>; what is to be done for thee? wouldest thou be spoken for to the king, or to the captain of the host? And she said, I dwell among mine own people.
<DT><A NAME="4:14">4:14</A><DD>And he said, What then is to be done for her? And Gehazi said, Verily, she has no son, and her husband is old.
<DT><A NAME="4:15">4:15</A><DD>And he said, Call her; and he called her; and she stood in the doorway.
<DT><A NAME="4:16">4:16</A><DD>And he said, At this appointed time, when thy term is <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2ki?n=4:16">come</A>, thou shalt embrace a son. And she said, No, my lord, man of God, do not lie to thy handmaid.
<DT><A NAME="4:17">4:17</A><DD>And the woman conceived, and bore a son at that appointed time in the next year as Elisha had said to her.
<DT><A NAME="4:18">4:18</A><DD>And the child grew, and it came to pass <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2ki?n=4:18">one</A> day, that he went out to his father to the reapers.
<DT><A NAME="4:19">4:19</A><DD>And he said to his father, My head, my head! And he said to the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2ki?n=4:12">servant</A>, Carry him to his mother.
<DT><A NAME="4:20">4:20</A><DD>And he carried him, and brought him to his mother; and he sat on her knees till noon, and died.

<DT><A NAME="5:14">5:14</A><DD>Then he went down, and plunged himself seven times in the Jordan, according to the saying of the man of God. And his flesh became again like the flesh of a little child, and he was clean.

<DT><A NAME="5:26">5:26</A><DD>And he said to him, Did not my heart go, when the man turned again from his chariot to meet thee? Is it a time to receive money, and to receive garments, and oliveyards, and vineyards, and sheep, and oxen, and bondmen, and bondwomen?

<DT><A NAME="17:1">17:1</A><DD>In the twelfth year of Ahaz king of Judah, Hoshea the son of Elah began to reign in Samaria over Israel, for nine years.
<DT><A NAME="17:2">17:2</A><DD>And he did evil in the sight of Jehovah, but not as the kings of Israel that had been before him.
<DT><A NAME="17:3">17:3</A><DD>Against him came up Shalmaneser king of Assyria, and Hoshea became his servant, and tendered him presents.
<DT><A NAME="17:4">17:4</A><DD>But the king of Assyria found conspiracy in Hoshea; for he had sent messengers to So king of Egypt, and sent up no present to the king of Assyria as <I>he had done</I> from year to year. And the king of Assyria shut him up and bound him in prison.
<DT><A NAME="17:5">17:5</A><DD>And the king of Assyria overran the whole land, and went up against Samaria, and besieged it three years.
<DT><A NAME="17:6">17:6</A><DD>In the ninth year of Hoshea, the king of Assyria took Samaria, and carried Israel away into Assyria, and placed them in Halah and by the Habor, the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes.
<DT><A NAME="17:7">17:7</A><DD>And so it was, because the children of Israel had sinned against Jehovah their God, who had brought them up out of the land of Egypt from under the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and had feared other gods;
<DT><A NAME="17:8">17:8</A><DD>and they walked in the statutes of the nations that Jehovah had dispossessed from before the children of Israel, and of the kings of Israel, which they had made.
<DT><A NAME="17:9">17:9</A><DD>And the children of Israel did secretly against Jehovah their God things that were not right; and they built them high places in all their cities, from the watchmen's tower to the fortified city.
<DT><A NAME="17:10">17:10</A><DD>And they set them up <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2ki?n=17:10">columns</A> and Asherahs on every high hill and under every green tree;
<DT><A NAME="17:11">17:11</A><DD>and there they burned incense on all the high places, as did the nations that Jehovah had carried away from before them, and they wrought wicked things to provoke Jehovah to anger;
<DT><A NAME="17:12">17:12</A><DD>and they served idols, as to which Jehovah had said to them, Ye shall not do this thing.
<DT><A NAME="17:13">17:13</A><DD>And Jehovah testified against Israel and against Judah, by all the prophets, all the seers, saying, Turn from your evil ways, and keep my commandments, my statutes, according to all the law which I commanded your fathers, and which I sent to you through my servants the prophets.
<DT><A NAME="17:14">17:14</A><DD>But they would not hear, and hardened their necks, like to the neck of their fathers, who did not believe in Jehovah their God.
<DT><A NAME="17:15">17:15</A><DD>And they rejected his <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2ki?n=17:15">statutes</A>, and his covenant which he had made with their fathers, and his testimonies which he had testified unto them; and they followed vanity and became <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2ki?n=17:15a">vain</A>, and <I>went</I> after the nations that were round about them, concerning whom Jehovah had charged them that they should not do like them.
<DT><A NAME="17:16">17:16</A><DD>And they forsook all the commandments of Jehovah their God, and made them molten images, two calves, and made an Asherah, and worshipped all the host of the heavens, and served Baal;
<DT><A NAME="17:17">17:17</A><DD>and they caused their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire, and used divination and enchantments, and sold themselves to do evil in the sight of Jehovah, to provoke him to anger.
<DT><A NAME="17:18">17:18</A><DD>Therefore Jehovah was very angry with Israel, and removed them out of his sight: there remained but the tribe of Judah only.
<DT><A NAME="17:19">17:19</A><DD>Also Judah kept not the commandments of Jehovah their God, but walked in the statutes of Israel which they had made.
<DT><A NAME="17:20">17:20</A><DD>And Jehovah rejected all the seed of Israel; and afflicted them, and delivered them into the hand of spoilers, until he had cast them out of his sight.
<DT><A NAME="17:21">17:21</A><DD>For Israel had rent <I>the kingdom</I> <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2ki?n=17:21">from</A> the house of David; and they had made Jeroboam the son of Nebat king; and Jeroboam violently turned Israel from following Jehovah, and made them sin a great sin.
<DT><A NAME="17:22">17:22</A><DD>And the children of Israel walked in all the sins of Jeroboam which he did; they did not depart from them:
<DT><A NAME="17:23">17:23</A><DD>until Jehovah had removed Israel out of his sight, as he had said through all his servants the prophets; and Israel was carried away out of their own land to Assyria, unto this day.
<DT><A NAME="17:24">17:24</A><DD>And the king of Assyria brought <I>people</I> from <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2ki?n=17:24">Babylon</A>, and from Cuthah, and from Avva, and from Hamath, and from Sepharvaim, and made them dwell in the cities of Samaria instead of the children of Israel; and they possessed Samaria, and dwelt in its cities.
<DT><A NAME="17:25">17:25</A><DD>And so it was, at the beginning of their dwelling there, that they feared not Jehovah; and Jehovah sent lions among them, which killed <I>some</I> of them.
<DT><A NAME="17:26">17:26</A><DD>And they spoke to the king of Assyria saying, The nations that thou hast removed and made to dwell in the cities of Samaria know not the manner of the god of the land; therefore he has sent lions among them, and behold, they slay them, because they know not the manner of the god of the land.
<DT><A NAME="17:27">17:27</A><DD>And the king of Assyria commanded saying, Carry thither one of the priests whom ye have brought away from thence; and let them go and abide there, and let him teach them the manner of the god of the land.
<DT><A NAME="17:28">17:28</A><DD>Then one of the priests whom they had carried away from Samaria came and abode in Bethel, and taught them how they should fear Jehovah.
<DT><A NAME="17:29">17:29</A><DD>And every nation made gods of their own, and put them in the houses of the high places that the Samaritans had made, every nation in their cities in which they dwelt.
<DT><A NAME="17:30">17:30</A><DD>And the people of Babylon made Succoth-benoth, and the people of <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2ki?n=17:30">Cuth</A> made Nergal, and the people of Hamath made Ashima,
<DT><A NAME="17:31">17:31</A><DD>and the Avvites made Nibhaz and Tartak, and the Sepharvites burned their children in the fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech the gods of Sepharvaim.
<DT><A NAME="17:32">17:32</A><DD>So they feared Jehovah, and made to themselves from all <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2ki?n=17:32">classes</A> of them priests of the high places, who offered <I>sacrifices</I> for them in the houses of the high places.
<DT><A NAME="17:33">17:33</A><DD>They feared Jehovah, and served their own gods after the manner of the nations, whence they had been carried away.
<DT><A NAME="17:34">17:34</A><DD>To this day they do after their former customs: they fear not Jehovah, neither do they after their statutes or after their ordinances, nor after the law and commandment that Jehovah commanded the sons of Jacob, whom he named Israel.
<DT><A NAME="17:35">17:35</A><DD>And Jehovah had made a covenant with them, and charged them saying, Ye shall not fear other gods, nor bow down yourselves <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2ki?n=17:35">to</A> them, nor serve them, nor sacrifice to them;
<DT><A NAME="17:36">17:36</A><DD>but Jehovah alone, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt with great power and a stretched-out arm, him shall ye fear, and him shall ye worship, and to him shall ye do sacrifice.
<DT><A NAME="17:37">17:37</A><DD>And the statutes and the ordinances and the law, and the commandment which he wrote for you, ye shall observe to do for evermore; and ye shall not fear other gods.

<DT><A NAME="17:40">17:40</A><DD>And they did not hearken, but did after their former customs.
