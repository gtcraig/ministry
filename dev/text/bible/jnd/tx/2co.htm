<DT><A NAME="1:1">1:1</A><DD>Paul, apostle of Jesus Christ by God's will, and the brother Timotheus, to the assembly of God which is in Corinth, with all the saints who are in the whole of Achaia.
<DT><A NAME="1:2">1:2</A><DD>Grace to you, and peace from God our Father, and <I>the</I> Lord Jesus Christ.
<DT><A NAME="1:3">1:3</A><DD>Blessed <I>be</I> the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of compassions, and God of all encouragement;
<DT><A NAME="1:4">1:4</A><DD>who <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2co?n=1:4">encourages</A> us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to encourage those who are in any tribulation whatever, through the encouragement with which we ourselves are encouraged of God.
<DT><A NAME="1:5">1:5</A><DD>Because, even as the sufferings of the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2co?n=1:5">Christ</A> abound towards us, so through the Christ does our encouragement also abound.
<DT><A NAME="1:6">1:6</A><DD>But whether we are in tribulation, <I>it is</I> for your encouragement and salvation, wrought in the endurance of the same sufferings which *we* also suffer,
<DT><A NAME="1:7">1:7</A><DD>(and our hope for you <I>is</I> sure;) or whether we are encouraged, <I>it is</I> for your encouragement and salvation: knowing that as ye are partakers of the sufferings, so also of the encouragement.
<DT><A NAME="1:8">1:8</A><DD>For we do not wish you to be ignorant, brethren, as to our tribulation which happened <I>to us</I> in Asia, that we were excessively pressed beyond <I>our</I> power, so as to despair even of living.
<DT><A NAME="1:9">1:9</A><DD>But we ourselves had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not have our trust in ourselves, but <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2co?n=1:9">in</A> God who raises the dead;
<DT><A NAME="1:10">1:10</A><DD>who has delivered us from so great a death, and does deliver; in whom we confide that he will also yet deliver;
<DT><A NAME="1:11">1:11</A><DD>ye also labouring together by supplication for us that the gift towards us, through means of many persons, may be the subject of the thanksgiving of many for us.
<DT><A NAME="1:12">1:12</A><DD>For our boasting is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in simplicity and sincerity before <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2co?n=1:12">God</A>, (not in fleshly wisdom but in God's grace,) we have had our conversation in the world, and more abundantly towards you.
<DT><A NAME="1:13">1:13</A><DD>For we do not write other things to you but what ye well <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2co?n=1:13">know</A> and recognise; and I hope that ye will <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2co?n=1:13a">recognise</A> to the end,
<DT><A NAME="1:14">1:14</A><DD>even as also ye have recognised us in part, that we are your boast, even as *ye* <I>are</I> ours in the day of the Lord Jesus.
<DT><A NAME="1:15">1:15</A><DD>And with this confidence I purposed to come to you previously, that ye might have a second favour;
<DT><A NAME="1:16">1:16</A><DD>and to pass through to Macedonia by you, and again from Macedonia to come to you, and to be set forward by you to Judaea.
<DT><A NAME="1:17">1:17</A><DD>Having therefore this purpose, did I then use lightness? Or what I purpose, do I purpose according to flesh, that there should be with me yea yea, and nay nay?
<DT><A NAME="1:18">1:18</A><DD>Now God <I>is</I> faithful, that our word to you is not yea and nay.
<DT><A NAME="1:19">1:19</A><DD>For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, he who has been preached by us among you (by me and <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2co?n=1:19">Silvanus</A> and Timotheus), did not become yea and nay, but yea <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2co?n=1:19a">*is*</A> in him.
<DT><A NAME="1:20">1:20</A><DD>For whatever promises of God <I>there are</I>, in him is the yea, and in him the amen, for glory to God by <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2co?n=1:20">us</A>.
<DT><A NAME="1:21">1:21</A><DD>Now he that establishes us with you <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2co?n=1:21">in</A> Christ, and has anointed us, <I>is</I> God,
<DT><A NAME="1:22">1:22</A><DD>who also has sealed us, and given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts.
<DT><A NAME="1:23">1:23</A><DD>But I call God to witness upon my soul that to spare you I have not yet come to Corinth.
<DT><A NAME="1:24">1:24</A><DD>Not that we rule over your faith, but are fellow-workmen of your joy: for by faith ye stand.
</DL></DIV><H2>Chapter 2</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="2:1">2:1</A><DD>But I have judged this with myself, not to come back to you in grief.
<DT><A NAME="2:2">2:2</A><DD>For if *I* grieve you, who also <I>is</I> it that gladdens me, if not he that is grieved through me?
<DT><A NAME="2:3">2:3</A><DD>And I have written this very <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2co?n=2:3"><I>letter</I></A> <I>to you</I>, that coming I may not have grief from those from whom I ought to have joy; trusting in you all that my joy is <I>that</I> of you all.
<DT><A NAME="2:4">2:4</A><DD>For out of much tribulation and distress of heart I <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2co?n=2:4">wrote</A> to you, with many tears; not that ye may be grieved, but that ye may know the love which I have very abundantly towards you.
<DT><A NAME="2:5">2:5</A><DD>But if any one has grieved, he has grieved, not me, but in part (that I may not overcharge <I>you</I>) all of you.
<DT><A NAME="2:6">2:6</A><DD>Sufficient to such a one <I>is</I> this <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2co?n=2:6">rebuke</A> which <I>has been inflicted</I> by the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2co?n=2:6a">many</A>;
<DT><A NAME="2:7">2:7</A><DD>so that on the contrary ye should rather shew <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2co?n=2:7">grace</A> and encourage, lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with excessive grief.
<DT><A NAME="2:8">2:8</A><DD>Wherefore I exhort you to assure him of <I>your</I> love.
<DT><A NAME="2:9">2:9</A><DD>For to this end also I have written, that I might know, by putting you to the test, if as to everything ye are obedient.
<DT><A NAME="2:10">2:10</A><DD>But to whom ye forgive anything, *I* also; for I also, what I have <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2co?n=2:10">forgiven</A>, if I have <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2co?n=2:10">forgiven</A> anything, <I>it is</I> for your sakes in <I>the</I> person of Christ;
<DT><A NAME="2:11">2:11</A><DD>that we might not have Satan get an advantage against us, for we are not ignorant of *his* thoughts.
<DT><A NAME="2:12">2:12</A><DD>Now when I came to Troas for the <I>publication of the</I> glad tidings of the Christ, a door also being opened to me in <I>the</I> Lord,
<DT><A NAME="2:13">2:13</A><DD>I had no rest in my spirit at not finding Titus my brother; but bidding them adieu, I came away to Macedonia.
<DT><A NAME="2:14">2:14</A><DD>But thanks <I>be</I> to God, who always leads us in triumph in the Christ, and makes manifest the odour of his knowledge through us in every place.
<DT><A NAME="2:15">2:15</A><DD>For we are a sweet <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2co?n=2:15">odour</A> of Christ to God, in the saved and in those that perish:
<DT><A NAME="2:16">2:16</A><DD>to the one an odour from death unto death, but to the others an odour from life unto life; and who <I>is</I> sufficient for these things?
<DT><A NAME="2:17">2:17</A><DD>For we do not, as the many, make a trade <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2co?n=2:17">of</A> the word of God; but as of sincerity, but as of God, before God, we speak in Christ.
</DL></DIV><H2>Chapter 3</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="3:1">3:1</A><DD>Do we begin again to commend ourselves? or do we need, as some, commendatory letters to you, or <I>commendatory</I> from you?
<DT><A NAME="3:2">3:2</A><DD>*Ye* are our letter, written in our hearts, known and <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2co?n=3:2">read</A> of all men,
<DT><A NAME="3:3">3:3</A><DD>being manifested to <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2co?n=3:3">be</A> Christ's epistle ministered by us, written, not with ink, but <I>the</I> Spirit of <I>the</I> living God; not on stone tables, but on fleshy tables of <I>the</I> heart.
<DT><A NAME="3:4">3:4</A><DD>And such confidence have we through the Christ towards God:
<DT><A NAME="3:5">3:5</A><DD>not that we are <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2co?n=3:5">competent</A> of ourselves to think anything as of ourselves, but our competency <I>is</I> of God;
<DT><A NAME="3:6">3:6</A><DD>who has also made us competent, <I>as</I> ministers of <I>the</I> new <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2co?n=3:6">covenant</A>; not of letter, but of spirit. For the letter <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2co?n=3:6a">kills</A>, but the Spirit quickens.
<DT><A NAME="3:7">3:7</A><DD>(But if the ministry of death, in letters, graven in stones, <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2co?n=3:7">began</A> with glory, so that the children of Israel could not fix their eyes on the face of <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2co?n=3:7a">Moses</A>, on account of the glory of his face, <I>a glory</I> which is annulled;
<DT><A NAME="3:8">3:8</A><DD>how shall not rather the ministry of the Spirit subsist in glory?
<DT><A NAME="3:9">3:9</A><DD>For if the ministry of condemnation <I>be</I> glory, much rather the ministry of righteousness abounds in glory.
<DT><A NAME="3:10">3:10</A><DD>For also that <I>which was</I> glorified is not glorified in this respect, on account of the surpassing glory.
<DT><A NAME="3:11">3:11</A><DD>For if that <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2co?n=3:11">annulled</A> <I>was introduced</I> with glory, much rather that which abides <I>subsists</I> in glory.
<DT><A NAME="3:12">3:12</A><DD>Having therefore such hope, we use much boldness:
<DT><A NAME="3:13">3:13</A><DD>and not according as Moses put a veil on his own face, so that the children of Israel should not fix their eyes on the end of that annulled.
<DT><A NAME="3:14">3:14</A><DD>But their thoughts have been <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2co?n=3:14">darkened</A>, for unto this day the same veil remains in reading the old covenant, unremoved, which in Christ is <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2co?n=3:14a">annulled</A>.
<DT><A NAME="3:15">3:15</A><DD>But unto this day, when Moses is read, the veil lies upon their heart.
<DT><A NAME="3:16">3:16</A><DD>But when it shall turn to <I>the</I> Lord, the veil is taken <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2co?n=3:16">away</A>.)
<DT><A NAME="3:17">3:17</A><DD>Now the Lord is the Spirit, but where the Spirit of <I>the</I> Lord <I>is, there is</I> liberty.
<DT><A NAME="3:18">3:18</A><DD>But *we* all, looking on the glory of the Lord, with unveiled face, are <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2co?n=3:18">transformed</A> according to the same image from glory to glory, even as by <I>the</I> Lord <I>the</I> <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2co?n=3:18a">Spirit</A>.
</DL></DIV><H2>Chapter 4</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="4:1">4:1</A><DD>Therefore, having this ministry, as we have had mercy shewn us, we faint not.
<DT><A NAME="4:2">4:2</A><DD>But we have rejected the hidden things of <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2co?n=4:2">shame</A>, not walking in deceit, nor falsifying the word of God, but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every conscience of men before God.
<DT><A NAME="4:3">4:3</A><DD>But if also our gospel is veiled, it is veiled in those that are <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2co?n=4:3">lost</A>;
<DT><A NAME="4:4">4:4</A><DD>in whom the god of this world has blinded the thoughts of the unbelieving, so that the radiancy of the glad tidings of the glory of the Christ, who is <I>the</I> image of God, should not shine <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2co?n=4:4">forth</A> <I>for them</I>.
<DT><A NAME="4:5">4:5</A><DD>For we do not preach ourselves, but Christ Jesus Lord, and ourselves your bondmen for Jesus' sake.
<DT><A NAME="4:6">4:6</A><DD>Because <I>it is</I> the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2co?n=4:6">God</A> who spoke that out of darkness light should <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2co?n=4:6a">shine</A> who has shone in our hearts for the shining <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2co?n=4:6b">forth</A> of the knowledge of the glory of God in <I>the</I> face of <I>Jesus</I> Christ.
<DT><A NAME="4:7">4:7</A><DD>But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the surpassingness of the power may be of God, and not from us:
<DT><A NAME="4:8">4:8</A><DD>every way afflicted, but not straitened; seeing no apparent issue, but our way not entirely shut up;
<DT><A NAME="4:9">4:9</A><DD>persecuted, but not abandoned; cast down, but not destroyed;
<DT><A NAME="4:10">4:10</A><DD>always bearing about in the body the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2co?n=4:10">dying</A> of Jesus, that the life also of Jesus may be manifested in our body;
<DT><A NAME="4:11">4:11</A><DD>for we who live are always delivered unto death on account of Jesus, that the life also of Jesus may be manifested in our mortal flesh;
<DT><A NAME="4:12">4:12</A><DD>so that death works in us, but life in you.
<DT><A NAME="4:13">4:13</A><DD>And having the same spirit of faith, according to what is <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2co?n=4:13">written</A>, I have believed, therefore have I spoken; *we* also believe, therefore also we speak;
<DT><A NAME="4:14">4:14</A><DD>knowing that he who has raised the Lord Jesus shall raise us also with Jesus, and shall present <I>us</I> with you.
<DT><A NAME="4:15">4:15</A><DD>For all things <I>are</I> for your sakes, that the grace abounding through the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2co?n=4:15">many</A> may cause thanksgiving to abound to the glory of God.
<DT><A NAME="4:16">4:16</A><DD>Wherefore we faint not; but if indeed our outward man is consumed, yet the inward is renewed day by day.
<DT><A NAME="4:17">4:17</A><DD>For our momentary <I>and</I> <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2co?n=4:17">light</A> affliction works for us in surpassing measure an eternal weight of glory;
<DT><A NAME="4:18">4:18</A><DD><A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2co?n=4:18">while</A> we look not at the things that are seen, but at the things that are not seen; for the things that are seen <I>are</I> for a time, but those that are not seen eternal.
</DL></DIV><H2>Chapter 5</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="5:1">5:1</A><DD>For we know that if our earthly tabernacle <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2co?n=5:1">house</A> be destroyed, we have a building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.
<DT><A NAME="5:2">5:2</A><DD>For indeed in this we groan, ardently desiring to have put on our house which <I>is</I> <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2co?n=5:2">from</A> heaven;
<DT><A NAME="5:3">5:3</A><DD>if indeed being also clothed we shall not be found naked.
<DT><A NAME="5:4">5:4</A><DD>For indeed we who are in the tabernacle groan, being burdened; while <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2co?n=5:4">yet</A> we do not wish to be unclothed, but clothed, that <I>what is</I> mortal may be swallowed up by life.
<DT><A NAME="5:5">5:5</A><DD>Now he that has wrought us for this very thing <I>is</I> God, who also has given to us the earnest of the Spirit.
<DT><A NAME="5:6">5:6</A><DD>Therefore <I>we are</I> always confident, and <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2co?n=5:6">know</A> that while <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2co?n=5:6a">present</A> in the body we are <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2co?n=5:6a">absent</A> from the Lord,
<DT><A NAME="5:7">5:7</A><DD>(for we walk by faith, not by sight;)
<DT><A NAME="5:8">5:8</A><DD>we are confident, I say, and pleased rather to be absent from the body and present with the Lord.
<DT><A NAME="5:9">5:9</A><DD>Wherefore also we are zealous, whether present or absent, to be agreeable to him.
<DT><A NAME="5:10">5:10</A><DD>For we must all be manifested before the judgment-seat of the Christ, that each may receive the things <I>done</I> <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2co?n=5:10">in</A> the body, according to those he has done, whether <I>it be</I> good or evil.
<DT><A NAME="5:11">5:11</A><DD>Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord we persuade men, but have <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2co?n=5:11">been</A> manifested to God, and I hope also that we have <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2co?n=5:11">been</A> manifested in your consciences.
<DT><A NAME="5:12">5:12</A><DD><I>For</I> we do not again commend ourselves to you, but <I>we are</I> giving to you occasion of boast in our behalf, that ye may have <I>such</I> with those boasting in <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2co?n=5:12">countenance</A>, and not in heart.
<DT><A NAME="5:13">5:13</A><DD>For whether we are beside ourselves, <I>it is</I> to <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2co?n=5:13">God</A>; or are sober, <I>it is</I> for you.
<DT><A NAME="5:14">5:14</A><DD>For the love of the Christ constrains us, having judged this: that one died for all, then all have <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2co?n=5:14">died</A>;

<DT><A NAME="8:3">8:3</A><DD>For according to <I>their</I> power, I bear witness, and beyond <I>their</I> power, <I>they were</I> willing of their own accord,

<DT><A NAME="11:20">11:20</A><DD>For ye bear if any one bring you into bondage, if any one devour <I>you</I>, if any one get <I>your money</I>, if any one exalt himself, if any one beat you on the face.
<DT><A NAME="11:21">11:21</A><DD>I speak as to dishonour, as though *we* had been weak; but wherein any one is daring, (I speak in folly,) *I* also am daring.
<DT><A NAME="11:22">11:22</A><DD>Are they Hebrews? *I* also. Are they Israelites? *I* also. Are they seed of Abraham? *I* also.
<DT><A NAME="11:23">11:23</A><DD>Are they <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2co?n=11:23">ministers</A> of Christ?

<DT><A NAME="11:24">11:24</A><DD>From the Jews five times have I received forty <I>stripes</I>, save <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2co?n=11:24">one</A>.
<DT><A NAME="11:25">11:25</A><DD>Thrice have I been scourged, once I have been stoned, three times I have suffered shipwreck, a night and day I passed in the deep:
<DT><A NAME="11:26">11:26</A><DD>in journeyings often, in perils of rivers, in perils of robbers, in perils from <I>my own</I> race, in perils from <I>the</I> nations, in perils in <I>the</I> city, in perils in <I>the</I> desert, in perils on <I>the</I> sea, in perils among false brethren;

<DT><A NAME="11:28">11:28</A><DD>Besides those things that are without, the crowd <I>of cares</I> pressing on me daily, the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2co?n=11:28">burden</A> of all the assemblies.
<DT><A NAME="11:29">11:29</A><DD>Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is stumbled, and I burn not?

<DT><A NAME="11:32">11:32</A><DD>In Damascus the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2co?n=11:32">ethnarch</A> of Aretas the king kept the city of the Damascenes shut up, wishing to take me;
<DT><A NAME="11:33">11:33</A><DD>and through a window in a basket I was let down <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2co?n=11:33">by</A> the wall, and escaped his hands.
</DL></DIV><H2>Chapter 12</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="12:1">12:1</A><DD>Well, it is not of profit to me to boast, for I will come to visions and revelations of <I>the</I> Lord.
<DT><A NAME="12:2">12:2</A><DD>I <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2co?n=12:2">know</A> a man in Christ, fourteen years ago, (whether in <I>the</I> body I know not, or out of the body I know not, God knows;) such <I>a one</I> caught up <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2co?n=12:2a">to</A> <I>the</I> third heaven.
<DT><A NAME="12:3">12:3</A><DD>And I know such a man, (whether in <I>the</I> body or out of the body I know not, God knows;)
<DT><A NAME="12:4">12:4</A><DD>that he was caught up into paradise, and heard unspeakable things <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2co?n=12:4">said</A> which it is not allowed to man to utter.
<DT><A NAME="12:5">12:5</A><DD>Of such <I>a one</I> I will boast, but of myself I will not boast, unless in my weaknesses.
<DT><A NAME="12:6">12:6</A><DD>For if I shall desire to boast, I shall not be a fool; for I will say <I>the</I> truth; but I forbear, lest any one should think as to me above what he sees me <I>to be</I>, or whatever he may hear of me.
<DT><A NAME="12:7">12:7</A><DD>And that I might not be exalted by the exceeding greatness of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn for the flesh, a messenger of Satan that he might <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2co?n=12:7">buffet</A> me, that I might not be exalted.
<DT><A NAME="12:8">12:8</A><DD>For this I thrice besought the Lord that it might depart from me.
<DT><A NAME="12:9">12:9</A><DD>And he said to me, <FONT CLASS=r>My grace suffices thee; for <I>my</I> power is perfected in weakness.</FONT> Most gladly therefore will I rather boast in my weaknesses, that the power of the Christ may <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2co?n=12:9">dwell</A> upon me.
<DT><A NAME="12:10">12:10</A><DD>Wherefore I take pleasure in weaknesses, in insults, in necessities, in persecutions, in straits, for Christ: for when I am weak, then I am powerful.
<DT><A NAME="12:11">12:11</A><DD>I have become a fool; *ye* have compelled me; for *I* ought to have been commended by you; for I have been nothing behind those who were in surpassing degree apostles, if also I am nothing.
<DT><A NAME="12:12">12:12</A><DD>The signs indeed of the apostle were wrought among you in all endurance, signs, and wonders, and works of power.
<DT><A NAME="12:13">12:13</A><DD>For in what is it that ye have been inferior to the other assemblies, unless that I myself have not been in laziness a charge upon you? Forgive me this injury.
<DT><A NAME="12:14">12:14</A><DD>Behold, this third time I am ready to come to you, and I will not be in laziness a charge; for I do not seek yours, but you; for the children ought not to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children.
<DT><A NAME="12:15">12:15</A><DD>Now *I* shall most gladly spend and be utterly spent for your souls, if even in abundantly loving you I should be less loved.
<DT><A NAME="12:16">12:16</A><DD>But be it so. *I* did not burden you, but being crafty I took you by <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2co?n=12:16">guile</A>.
<DT><A NAME="12:17">12:17</A><DD>Did I make gain of you by any of those whom I have sent to you?
<DT><A NAME="12:18">12:18</A><DD>I begged Titus, and sent the brother with <I>him</I>: did Titus at all make gain of you? have we not walked in the same spirit? <I>have we</I> not in the same steps?
<DT><A NAME="12:19">12:19</A><DD>Ye have long been <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2co?n=12:19">supposing</A> that we excuse ourselves to you: we speak before God in Christ; and all things, beloved, for your building up.
<DT><A NAME="12:20">12:20</A><DD>For I fear lest perhaps coming I find you not such as I wish, and that *I* be found by you such as ye do not wish: lest <I>there might be</I> strifes, jealousies, angers, contentions, evil speakings, whisperings, puffings up, disturbances;
<DT><A NAME="12:21">12:21</A><DD>lest my God should humble me as <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2co?n=12:21">to</A> you when I come again, and that I shall grieve over many of those who have sinned before, and have not repented as to the uncleanness and fornication and licentiousness which they have practised.
</DL></DIV><H2>Chapter 13</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="13:1">13:1</A><DD>This third time I am coming to you. In the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2co?n=13:1">matter</A> be established.
<DT><A NAME="13:2">13:2</A><DD>I have declared beforehand, and I say beforehand as present the second time, and now absent, to those that have sinned before, and to all the rest, that if I come again I will not spare.
<DT><A NAME="13:3">13:3</A><DD>Since ye seek a proof of <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2co?n=13:3">Christ</A> speaking in me, (who is not weak towards you, but is powerful among you,
<DT><A NAME="13:4">13:4</A><DD>for if indeed he has been crucified <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2co?n=13:4">in</A> weakness, yet he lives <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2co?n=13:4">by</A> God's power; for indeed *we* are weak in him, but we shall live with him by God's power towards you,)
<DT><A NAME="13:5">13:5</A><DD>examine your own selves if ye be in the faith; prove your own selves: do ye not recognise <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2co?n=13:5">yourselves</A>, that Jesus Christ is in you, unless indeed ye be reprobates?
<DT><A NAME="13:6">13:6</A><DD>Now I hope that ye will know that *we* are not reprobates.
<DT><A NAME="13:7">13:7</A><DD>But we pray to God that ye may do nothing evil; not that *we* may appear approved, but that *ye* may do what is right, and *we* be as reprobates.
<DT><A NAME="13:8">13:8</A><DD>For we can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth.
<DT><A NAME="13:9">13:9</A><DD>For we rejoice when *we* may be weak and *ye* may be powerful. But this also we pray for, your perfecting.
<DT><A NAME="13:10">13:10</A><DD>On this account I write these things being absent, that being present I may not use severity according to the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2co?n=13:10">authority</A> which the Lord has given me for building up, and not for <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2co?n=13:10a">overthrowing</A>.
<DT><A NAME="13:11">13:11</A><DD>For the rest, brethren, <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2co?n=13:11">rejoice</A>; be <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2co?n=13:11a">perfected</A>; be encouraged; be of one mind; be at peace; and the God of love and peace shall be with you.
<DT><A NAME="13:12">13:12</A><DD>Salute one another with a holy kiss.
<DT><A NAME="13:13">13:13</A><DD>All the saints salute you.
<DT><A NAME="13:14">13:14</A><DD>The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2co?n=13:14">communion</A> of the Holy Spirit, <I>be</I> with you all.
