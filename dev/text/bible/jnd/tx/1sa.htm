<H2>Chapter 1</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="1:1">1:1</A><DD>And there was a certain man of Ramathaim-zophim, of mount Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1sa?n=1:1">Ephrathite</A>.
<DT><A NAME="1:2">1:2</A><DD>And he had two wives: the name of the one was <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1sa?n=1:2">Hannah</A>, and the name of the other Peninnah; and Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children.
<DT><A NAME="1:3">1:3</A><DD>And this man went up out of his city from year to year to worship and to sacrifice to Jehovah of hosts in Shiloh. And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, the priests of Jehovah, were there.
<DT><A NAME="1:4">1:4</A><DD>And it came to pass on the day that Elkanah sacrificed, he gave to Peninnah his wife and to all her sons and her daughters portions;
<DT><A NAME="1:5">1:5</A><DD>but to Hannah he used to give a double portion, for he loved Hannah; but Jehovah had shut up her womb.
<DT><A NAME="1:6">1:6</A><DD>And her <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1sa?n=1:6">adversary</A> provoked her much also, to make her fret, because Jehovah had shut up her womb.
<DT><A NAME="1:7">1:7</A><DD>And <I>as</I> he did so year by year, as often as she went up to the house of Jehovah, she provoked her thus; and she wept and did not eat.
<DT><A NAME="1:8">1:8</A><DD>And Elkanah her husband said to her, Hannah, why weepest thou? and why eatest thou not? and why is thy heart grieved? Am not I better to thee than ten sons?
<DT><A NAME="1:9">1:9</A><DD>And Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after they had drunk; (now Eli the priest sat upon the seat by the door-post of the temple of Jehovah;)
<DT><A NAME="1:10">1:10</A><DD>and she was in bitterness of soul, and prayed to Jehovah, and wept much.
<DT><A NAME="1:11">1:11</A><DD>And she vowed a vow, and said, O Jehovah of hosts, if thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of thy handmaid, and remember me, and not forget thy handmaid, but wilt give unto thy handmaid a man child, then I will give him to Jehovah all the days of his life, and there shall no razor come upon his head.
<DT><A NAME="1:12">1:12</A><DD>And it came to pass as she continued praying before Jehovah, that Eli marked her mouth.
<DT><A NAME="1:13">1:13</A><DD>Now Hannah spoke in her heart; only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard; and Eli thought she was drunken.
<DT><A NAME="1:14">1:14</A><DD>And Eli said to her, How long wilt thou be drunken? put away thy wine from thee.
<DT><A NAME="1:15">1:15</A><DD>And Hannah answered and said, No, my lord, I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit: I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but have poured out my soul before Jehovah.
<DT><A NAME="1:16">1:16</A><DD>Take not thy handmaid for a daughter of <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1sa?n=1:16">Belial</A>: for out of the abundance of my grief and provocation have I spoken hitherto.
<DT><A NAME="1:17">1:17</A><DD>And Eli answered and said, Go in peace; and the God of Israel grant thee thy petition which thou hast asked of him.
<DT><A NAME="1:18">1:18</A><DD>And she said, Let thy bondwoman find grace in thy sight. And the woman went her way, and did eat, and her countenance was no more <I>as before</I>.
<DT><A NAME="1:19">1:19</A><DD>And they rose up early in the morning and worshipped before Jehovah, and returned and came to their house at Ramah. And Elkanah knew Hannah his wife; and Jehovah remembered her.
<DT><A NAME="1:20">1:20</A><DD>And it came to pass when the time was come about after Hannah had conceived, that she bore a son, and called his name <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1sa?n=1:20">Samuel</A>, <I>saying,</I> Because I have asked him of Jehovah.
<DT><A NAME="1:21">1:21</A><DD>And Elkanah her husband, and all his house, went up to sacrifice to Jehovah the yearly sacrifice and his vow.
<DT><A NAME="1:22">1:22</A><DD>But Hannah did not go up, for she said to her husband, <I>I will wait</I> until the child is weaned; then will I bring him, that he may appear before Jehovah, and there abide for ever.
<DT><A NAME="1:23">1:23</A><DD>And Elkanah her husband said to her, Do what is good in thy sight: abide until thou hast weaned him; only, may Jehovah fulfil his word. And the woman abode, and gave her son suck until she weaned him.
<DT><A NAME="1:24">1:24</A><DD>And she took him up with her when she had weaned him, with three bullocks, and one ephah of flour, and a flask of wine, and brought him to the house of Jehovah to Shiloh; and the boy was young.
<DT><A NAME="1:25">1:25</A><DD>And they slaughtered the bullock, and brought the boy to Eli.
<DT><A NAME="1:26">1:26</A><DD>And she said, Oh my lord, <I>as</I> thy soul liveth, my lord, I am the woman that stood by thee here to pray to Jehovah.
<DT><A NAME="1:27">1:27</A><DD>For this boy I prayed; and Jehovah has granted me my petition which I asked of him.
<DT><A NAME="1:28">1:28</A><DD>And also I have lent him to Jehovah: all the days that he lives, he is lent to Jehovah. And he worshipped Jehovah there.
</DL></DIV><H2>Chapter 2</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="2:1">2:1</A><DD>And Hannah prayed, and <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1sa?n=2:1">said</A>, My heart exulteth in Jehovah, my horn is lifted up <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1sa?n=2:1a">in</A> Jehovah; my mouth is opened wide over mine enemies; for I rejoice in thy salvation.
<DT><A NAME="2:2">2:2</A><DD>There is none holy as Jehovah, for there is none beside thee, neither is there any rock like our God.
<DT><A NAME="2:3">2:3</A><DD>Do not multiply your words of pride, let not vain-glory come out of your mouth; For Jehovah is a ùGod of <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1sa?n=2:3">knowledge</A>, and by him actions are weighed.
<DT><A NAME="2:4">2:4</A><DD>The bow of the mighty is broken, and they that stumbled are girded with strength.
<DT><A NAME="2:5">2:5</A><DD>They that were full have hired themselves out for bread; and the hungry are <I>so</I> no more: Even the barren beareth seven, and she that hath many children is waxed feeble.
<DT><A NAME="2:6">2:6</A><DD>Jehovah killeth, and maketh alive; he bringeth down to <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1sa?n=2:6">Sheol</A>, and bringeth up.
<DT><A NAME="2:7">2:7</A><DD>Jehovah maketh poor, and maketh rich, he bringeth low, also he lifteth up:
<DT><A NAME="2:8">2:8</A><DD>He raiseth up the poor out of the dust; from the dung-hill he lifteth up the needy, To set <I>him</I> among nobles; and he maketh them inherit a throne of glory; For the pillars of the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1sa?n=2:8">earth</A> are Jehovah's, and he hath set the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1sa?n=2:8a">world</A> upon them.
<DT><A NAME="2:9">2:9</A><DD>He keepeth the feet of his <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1sa?n=2:9">saints</A>, but the wicked are silenced in darkness; for by strength shall no man <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1sa?n=2:9a">prevail</A>.
<DT><A NAME="2:10">2:10</A><DD>They that strive with Jehovah shall be broken to pieces; in the heavens will he thunder upon them. Jehovah will judge the ends of the earth; and he will give strength unto his king, and exalt the horn of his anointed.
<DT><A NAME="2:11">2:11</A><DD>And Elkanah went to Ramah to his house. And the boy ministered to Jehovah in the presence of Eli the priest.
<DT><A NAME="2:12">2:12</A><DD>Now the sons of Eli were sons of Belial; they knew not Jehovah.
<DT><A NAME="2:13">2:13</A><DD>And the priests' custom with the people was, when any man sacrificed a sacrifice, the priest's <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1sa?n=2:13">servant</A> came, when the flesh was cooked, with a flesh-hook of three prongs in his hand;
<DT><A NAME="2:14">2:14</A><DD>and he struck it into the pan, or kettle, or cauldron, or pot; the priest took of it all that the flesh-hook brought up. So they did in Shiloh to all the Israelites that came there.
<DT><A NAME="2:15">2:15</A><DD>Even before they <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1sa?n=2:15">burned</A> the fat, the priest's servant came, and said to the man that sacrificed, Give flesh to roast for the priest, and he will not accept sodden flesh of thee, but raw.
<DT><A NAME="2:16">2:16</A><DD>If the man said to him, They will immediately <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1sa?n=2:15">burn</A> the fat entire, then take as thy soul desires; he would say <I>to him</I>, No, but thou shalt give <I>it</I> now; and if not, I will take <I>it</I> by force.
<DT><A NAME="2:17">2:17</A><DD>And the sin of the young men was very great before Jehovah, for men despised the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1sa?n=2:17">offering</A> of Jehovah.
<DT><A NAME="2:18">2:18</A><DD>And Samuel ministered before Jehovah, a boy girded with a linen ephod.
<DT><A NAME="2:19">2:19</A><DD>And his mother made him a little coat, and brought it to him from year to year, when she came up with her husband to sacrifice the yearly sacrifice.
<DT><A NAME="2:20">2:20</A><DD>And Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife, and said, Jehovah give thee seed of this woman for the loan which is lent to Jehovah. And they went to their own home.
<DT><A NAME="2:21">2:21</A><DD>So Jehovah visited Hannah, and she conceived, and bore three sons and two daughters. And the boy Samuel grew before Jehovah.
<DT><A NAME="2:22">2:22</A><DD>And Eli was very old, and heard all that his sons were doing to all Israel, and that they lay with the women that <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1sa?n=2:22">served</A> at the entrance of the tent of meeting.
<DT><A NAME="2:23">2:23</A><DD>And he said to them, Why do ye such things? for I hear of your evil deeds from all this people.
<DT><A NAME="2:24">2:24</A><DD>No, my sons, for it is no good report that I hear: ye make Jehovah's people transgress.
<DT><A NAME="2:25">2:25</A><DD>If one man sin against another, God will <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1sa?n=2:25">judge</A> him; but if a man sin against Jehovah, who shall intreat for him? But they hearkened not to the voice of their father, for Jehovah was minded to slay them.
<DT><A NAME="2:26">2:26</A><DD>And the boy Samuel grew on, and was in favour both with Jehovah and also with men.
<DT><A NAME="2:27">2:27</A><DD>And there came a man of God to Eli and said to him, Thus saith Jehovah: Did I plainly reveal myself to the house of thy father when they were in Egypt, <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1sa?n=2:27">in</A> Pharaoh's house,
<DT><A NAME="2:28">2:28</A><DD>and choose him out of all the tribes of Israel, to be my priest, to offer <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1sa?n=2:28">upon</A> mine altar, to burn incense, to wear the ephod before me? and I gave unto the house of thy father all the offerings by fire of the children of Israel.
<DT><A NAME="2:29">2:29</A><DD>Wherefore do ye trample upon my sacrifice and upon mine oblation which I have commanded <I>in my</I> habitation? And thou honourest thy sons above me, to make yourselves fat with the primest of all the oblations of Israel my people.
<DT><A NAME="2:30">2:30</A><DD>Wherefore Jehovah the God of Israel <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1sa?n=2:30">saith</A>, I said indeed, Thy house and the house of thy father should walk before me for ever. But now Jehovah <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1sa?n=2:30">saith</A>, Be it far from me; for them that honour me I will honour, and they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed.
<DT><A NAME="2:31">2:31</A><DD>Behold, days come, that I will cut off thine arm, and the arm of thy father's house, that there shall not be an old man in thy house.
<DT><A NAME="2:32">2:32</A><DD>And thou shalt see an <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1sa?n=2:32">oppressor</A> <I>in my</I> habitation, <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1sa?n=2:32a">amidst</A> all the good that shall be done to Israel; and there shall not be an old man in thy house for <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1sa?n=2:32b">ever</A>.
<DT><A NAME="2:33">2:33</A><DD>And the man of thine <I>whom</I> I shall not cut off from mine altar, shall be to cause thine eyes to fail and to grieve thy soul; and all the increase of thy house shall die in their vigour.
<DT><A NAME="2:34">2:34</A><DD>And this shall be the sign to thee, which shall come upon thy two sons, upon Hophni and Phinehas: in one day they shall die, both of them.
<DT><A NAME="2:35">2:35</A><DD>And I will raise up for myself a faithful priest, <I>who</I> shall do according to what is in my heart and in my mind; and I will build him a sure house; and he shall walk before mine anointed <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1sa?n=2:32b">continually</A>.
<DT><A NAME="2:36">2:36</A><DD>And it shall come to pass <I>that</I> every one that is left of thy house shall come to crouch to him for a small piece of silver and for a cake of bread, and shall say, Put me, I pray thee, <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1sa?n=2:36">into</A> one of the priestly offices, that I may eat a morsel of bread.
</DL></DIV><H2>Chapter 3</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="3:1">3:1</A><DD>And the boy Samuel ministered to Jehovah before Eli. And the word of Jehovah was rare in those days; a vision was not <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1sa?n=3:1">frequent</A>.
<DT><A NAME="3:2">3:2</A><DD>And it came to pass at that time, when Eli lay in his place (now his eyes began to grow dim, he could not see),
<DT><A NAME="3:3">3:3</A><DD>and the lamp of God had not yet gone out, and Samuel lay in the temple of Jehovah, where the ark of God was,
<DT><A NAME="3:4">3:4</A><DD>that Jehovah called to Samuel. And he said, Here am I.
<DT><A NAME="3:5">3:5</A><DD>And he ran to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst me. And he said, I did not call: lie down again. And he went and lay down.
<DT><A NAME="3:6">3:6</A><DD>And Jehovah called again, Samuel! And Samuel arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst me. And he said, I did not call, my son: lie down again.
<DT><A NAME="3:7">3:7</A><DD>Now Samuel did not yet know Jehovah, neither had the word of Jehovah yet been revealed to him.
<DT><A NAME="3:8">3:8</A><DD>And Jehovah called again the third time, Samuel! And he arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst me. And Eli perceived that Jehovah was calling the boy.
<DT><A NAME="3:9">3:9</A><DD>And Eli said to Samuel, Go, lie down; and it shall be, if he call thee, that thou shalt say, Speak, Jehovah, for thy servant heareth. So Samuel went and lay down in his place.
<DT><A NAME="3:10">3:10</A><DD>And Jehovah came, and <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1sa?n=3:10">stood</A>, and called as at the other times, Samuel, Samuel! And Samuel said, Speak, for thy servant heareth.
<DT><A NAME="3:11">3:11</A><DD>And Jehovah said to Samuel, Behold, I do a thing in Israel, at which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall tingle.
<DT><A NAME="3:12">3:12</A><DD>In that day I will perform against Eli all that I have spoken concerning his house; I will begin and make an end.
<DT><A NAME="3:13">3:13</A><DD>For I have declared to him that I will judge his house for ever, for the iniquity which he hath known: because his sons made themselves <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1sa?n=3:13">vile</A>, and he restrained them not.
<DT><A NAME="3:14">3:14</A><DD>And therefore I have sworn unto the house of Eli that the iniquity of Eli's house shall not <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1sa?n=3:14">be</A> expiated with sacrifice or oblation for ever.
<DT><A NAME="3:15">3:15</A><DD>And Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the house of Jehovah. And Samuel feared to declare the vision to Eli.
<DT><A NAME="3:16">3:16</A><DD>And Eli called Samuel, and said, Samuel, my son. And he said, Here am I.
<DT><A NAME="3:17">3:17</A><DD>And he said, What is the word that he has spoken to thee? I pray thee, keep it not back from me: God do so to thee, and more also, if thou keep back anything from me of all the word that he spoke to thee.
<DT><A NAME="3:18">3:18</A><DD>And Samuel told him all the words, and kept nothing back from him. And he said, It is Jehovah: let him do what is good in his sight.
<DT><A NAME="3:19">3:19</A><DD>And Samuel grew, and Jehovah was with him, and let none of his words fall to the ground.
<DT><A NAME="3:20">3:20</A><DD>And all Israel, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, knew that Samuel was established a prophet of Jehovah.
<DT><A NAME="3:21">3:21</A><DD>And Jehovah appeared again at Shiloh; for Jehovah revealed himself to Samuel at Shiloh by the word of Jehovah.
</DL></DIV><H2>Chapter 4</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="4:1">4:1</A><DD>And what Samuel had said happened to all Israel. And Israel went out against the Philistines to battle, and encamped beside <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1sa?n=4:1">Eben-ezer</A>; and the Philistines encamped in Aphek.
<DT><A NAME="4:2">4:2</A><DD>And the Philistines put themselves in array against Israel; and the battle <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1sa?n=4:2">spread</A>, and Israel was routed before the Philistines; and they slew in battle array in the field about four thousand men.
<DT><A NAME="4:3">4:3</A><DD>And the people came into the camp; and the elders of Israel said, Why has Jehovah smitten us to-day before the Philistines? Let us fetch ourselves the ark of the covenant of Jehovah out of Shiloh, that it may come among us, and save us out of the hand of our enemies.

<DT><A NAME="10:2">10:2</A><DD>When thou goest from me to-day, thou shalt meet two men by Rachel's sepulchre in the border of Benjamin at Zelzah; and they will say to thee, The asses are found which thou wentest to seek, and behold, thy father has dismissed the matter of the asses, and is anxious about you, saying, What shall I do for my son?
<DT><A NAME="10:3">10:3</A><DD>And thou shalt go on forward from thence, and shalt come to the oak of Tabor, and there shall meet thee three men going up to God, to Bethel, one carrying three kids, and another carrying three cakes of bread, and another carrying a flask of wine.
<DT><A NAME="10:4">10:4</A><DD>And they will ask after thy welfare, and give thee two loaves, which thou shalt receive of their hands.
<DT><A NAME="10:5">10:5</A><DD>After that thou shalt come to the hill of God, where are the outposts of the Philistines; and it shall come to pass, when thou comest thither, into the city, that thou shalt meet a company of prophets coming down from the high place with lute and tambour and pipe and harp before them; and they themselves prophesying.
<DT><A NAME="10:6">10:6</A><DD>And the Spirit of Jehovah will come upon thee, and thou shalt prophesy with them, and shalt be turned into another man.
<DT><A NAME="10:7">10:7</A><DD>And it shall be, when these signs shall come to thee, thou shalt do as thy hand shall find; for God is with thee.
<DT><A NAME="10:8">10:8</A><DD>And thou shalt go down before me to Gilgal; and behold, I will come down to thee, to offer up burnt-offerings, <I>and</I> to sacrifice sacrifices of peace-offerings: seven days shalt thou wait, until I come to thee and inform thee what thou shalt do.
<DT><A NAME="10:9">10:9</A><DD>And it was <I>so</I> that when he turned his back to go away from Samuel, God <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1sa?n=10:9">gave</A> him another heart; and all those signs came to pass that day.
<DT><A NAME="10:10">10:10</A><DD>And when they came thither to the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1sa?n=10:10">hill</A>, behold, a company of prophets met him; and the Spirit of God came upon him, and he prophesied among them.
<DT><A NAME="10:11">10:11</A><DD>And it came to pass, when all that knew him before saw that, behold, he prophesied among the prophets, then the people said one to another, What is this that has happened to the son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets?
<DT><A NAME="10:12">10:12</A><DD>And a man of that place answered and said, But who is their father? Therefore it became a proverb, Is Saul also among the prophets?
<DT><A NAME="10:13">10:13</A><DD>And when he had ended prophesying, he came to the high place.
<DT><A NAME="10:14">10:14</A><DD>And Saul's uncle said to him and to his servant, Whither went ye? And he said, To seek the asses; and when we saw that they were nowhere, we went to Samuel.
<DT><A NAME="10:15">10:15</A><DD>And Saul's uncle said, Tell me, I pray thee, what Samuel said to you.
<DT><A NAME="10:16">10:16</A><DD>And Saul said to his uncle, He told us for certain that the asses were found. But of the matter of the kingdom, of which Samuel had spoken, he told him not.
<DT><A NAME="10:17">10:17</A><DD>And Samuel called the people together to Jehovah to Mizpah.
<DT><A NAME="10:18">10:18</A><DD>And he said to the children of Israel, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, *I* brought up Israel out of Egypt, and delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all the kingdoms that oppressed you;
<DT><A NAME="10:19">10:19</A><DD>but *ye* have this day rejected your God, who himself saved you out of all your adversities and your troubles, and have said unto him, <I>Nay,</I> but a king shalt thou set over us. Now therefore present yourselves before Jehovah by your tribes, and by your thousands.
<DT><A NAME="10:20">10:20</A><DD>And Samuel caused all the tribes of Israel to come near, and the tribe of Benjamin was taken.
<DT><A NAME="10:21">10:21</A><DD>And he caused the tribe of Benjamin to come near by their families, and the family of Matri was taken; and Saul the son of Kish was taken. And they sought him, but he was not to be found.
<DT><A NAME="10:22">10:22</A><DD>Therefore they inquired of Jehovah further, Will the man yet come hither? And Jehovah answered, Behold, he hath hid himself among the baggage.
<DT><A NAME="10:23">10:23</A><DD>And they ran and fetched him thence; and when he stood among the people, he was higher than any of the people from his shoulders and upward.
<DT><A NAME="10:24">10:24</A><DD>And Samuel said to all the people, See ye him whom Jehovah has chosen, that there is none like him among all the people? And all the people shouted and said, May the king live.
<DT><A NAME="10:25">10:25</A><DD>And Samuel told the people the right of the kingdom, and wrote it in the book, and laid it before Jehovah. And Samuel sent all the people away, every man to his house.
<DT><A NAME="10:26">10:26</A><DD>And Saul also went home to Gibeah; and with him went the band, whose hearts God had touched.
<DT><A NAME="10:27">10:27</A><DD>But the children of Belial said, How should this man save us? And they despised him, and brought him no gifts. But he was as one deaf.

<DT><A NAME="11:1">11:1</A><DD>And Nahash the Ammonite came up and encamped against Jabesh-Gilead. And all the men of Jabesh said to Nahash, Make a covenant with us, and we will serve thee.
<DT><A NAME="11:2">11:2</A><DD>And Nahash the Ammonite said to them, On this <I>condition</I> will I treat with you, that I thrust out all your right eyes, and lay it for a reproach upon all Israel.
<DT><A NAME="11:3">11:3</A><DD>And the elders of Jabesh said to him, Allow us seven days, and we will send messengers into all the districts of Israel; and if there be no man to deliver us, we will come out to thee.
<DT><A NAME="11:4">11:4</A><DD>And the messengers came to Gibeah of Saul and told these words in the ears of the people. And all the people lifted up their voice and wept.
<DT><A NAME="11:5">11:5</A><DD>And behold, Saul came after the oxen from the field; and Saul said, What <I>aileth</I> the people that they weep? And they related to him the words of the men of Jabesh.
<DT><A NAME="11:6">11:6</A><DD>And the Spirit of God came upon Saul when he heard those words, and his anger was kindled greatly.
<DT><A NAME="11:7">11:7</A><DD>And he took a yoke of oxen and cut them in pieces, and sent throughout the territory of Israel by the hand of messengers, saying, Whoever comes not forth after Saul and after Samuel, so shall it be done to his oxen! And the fear of Jehovah fell on the people, and they came out as one man.
<DT><A NAME="11:8">11:8</A><DD>And he numbered them in Bezek, and the children of Israel were three hundred thousand, and the men of Judah thirty thousand.
<DT><A NAME="11:9">11:9</A><DD>And they said to the messengers that had come, Thus shall ye say to the men of Jabesh-Gilead: To-morrow ye shall have <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1sa?n=11:9">deliverance</A> when the sun is hot. And the messengers came and informed the men of Jabesh-Gilead; and they were glad.
<DT><A NAME="11:10">11:10</A><DD>And the men of Jabesh said, To-morrow we will come out to you, and ye may do with us according to all that is good in your sight.
<DT><A NAME="11:11">11:11</A><DD>And it came to pass the next day that Saul set the people in three companies; and they came into the midst of the camp in the morning watch, and smote Ammon until the heat of the day: and it came to pass that they who remained were scattered, and not two of them were left together.
<DT><A NAME="11:12">11:12</A><DD>And the people said to Samuel, Who is he that said, Shall Saul reign over us? bring the men, that we may put them to death.
<DT><A NAME="11:13">11:13</A><DD>But Saul said, There shall not a man be put to death this day; for to-day Jehovah has wrought deliverance in Israel.
<DT><A NAME="11:14">11:14</A><DD>And Samuel said to the people, Come and let us go to Gilgal, and renew the kingdom there.
<DT><A NAME="11:15">11:15</A><DD>And all the people went to Gilgal; and there they made Saul king before Jehovah in Gilgal; and there they sacrificed peace-offerings before Jehovah. And there Saul and all the men of Israel rejoiced exceedingly.

<DT><A NAME="12:1">12:1</A><DD>And Samuel said to all Israel, Behold, I have hearkened to your voice in all that ye said to me, and have made a king over you.
<DT><A NAME="12:2">12:2</A><DD>And now behold, the king walks before you; and I am old and grey-headed; and behold, my sons are with you; and I have walked before you from my youth up to this day.
<DT><A NAME="12:3">12:3</A><DD>Here I am: testify against me before Jehovah, and before his anointed. Whose ox have I taken? or whose ass have I taken? or whom have I defrauded? whom have I injured? or of whose hand have I received any <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1sa?n=12:3">ransom</A> and blinded mine eyes therewith? and I will restore it to you.
<DT><A NAME="12:4">12:4</A><DD>And they said, Thou hast not defrauded us, and thou hast not injured us, neither hast thou taken aught of any man's hand.
<DT><A NAME="12:5">12:5</A><DD>And he said to them, Jehovah is witness against you, and his anointed is witness this day, that ye have not found aught in my hand! And <I>the people</I> said, <I>He is</I> witness!
<DT><A NAME="12:6">12:6</A><DD>And Samuel said to the people, <I>It is</I> Jehovah who appointed Moses and Aaron, and who brought your fathers up out of the land of Egypt.
<DT><A NAME="12:7">12:7</A><DD>And now stand <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1sa?n=12:7">still</A>, that I may plead <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1sa?n=12:7a">with</A> you before Jehovah of all the righteous acts of Jehovah which he did to you and to your fathers.
<DT><A NAME="12:8">12:8</A><DD>When Jacob had come into Egypt, and your fathers cried to Jehovah, then Jehovah sent Moses and Aaron, and they brought your fathers forth out of Egypt, and made them dwell in this place.
<DT><A NAME="12:9">12:9</A><DD>And they forgot Jehovah their God, and he sold them into the hand of Sisera, captain of the host of Hazor, and into the hand of the Philistines, and into the hand of the king of Moab, and they fought against them.
<DT><A NAME="12:10">12:10</A><DD>And they cried to Jehovah and said, We have sinned, because we have forsaken Jehovah, and have served the Baals and the Ashtoreths; and now deliver us out of the hand of our enemies, and we will serve thee.
<DT><A NAME="12:11">12:11</A><DD>And Jehovah sent Jerubbaal and <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1sa?n=12:11">Bedan</A> and Jephthah and Samuel, and delivered you out of the hand of your enemies round about, so that ye dwelt in safety.
<DT><A NAME="12:12">12:12</A><DD>But when ye saw that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon came against you, ye said to me, Nay, but a king shall reign over us; when Jehovah your God was your king.
<DT><A NAME="12:13">12:13</A><DD>And now behold, the king whom ye have chosen, whom ye have asked for! and behold, Jehovah has set a king over you.
<DT><A NAME="12:14">12:14</A><DD>If ye fear Jehovah, and serve him, and hearken to his voice, and rebel not against the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1sa?n=12:14">commandment</A> of Jehovah, then both ye and the king also that reigns over you shall continue following Jehovah your God.
<DT><A NAME="12:15">12:15</A><DD>But if ye will not hearken to the voice of Jehovah, and if ye rebel against the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1sa?n=12:14">commandment</A> of Jehovah, then will the hand of Jehovah be against you, as against your fathers.
<DT><A NAME="12:16">12:16</A><DD>Now therefore stand and see this great thing which Jehovah will do before your eyes.
<DT><A NAME="12:17">12:17</A><DD>Is it not wheat-harvest to-day? I will call unto Jehovah, and he will send thunder and rain; and ye shall perceive and see that your wickedness is great which ye have done in the sight of Jehovah in asking for yourselves a king.
<DT><A NAME="12:18">12:18</A><DD>And Samuel called to Jehovah; and Jehovah sent thunder and rain that day. And all the people greatly feared Jehovah and Samuel.
<DT><A NAME="12:19">12:19</A><DD>And all the people said to Samuel, Pray to Jehovah thy God for thy servants, that we die not; for we have added to all our sins the wickedness to ask for ourselves a king.
<DT><A NAME="12:20">12:20</A><DD>And Samuel said to the people, Fear not: *ye* have done all this wickedness; yet turn not aside from following Jehovah, and serve Jehovah with all your heart;
<DT><A NAME="12:21">12:21</A><DD>and turn ye not aside; for <I>it would be</I> after <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1sa?n=12:21">vain</A> things which cannot profit nor deliver; for they are <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1sa?n=12:21">vain</A>.
<DT><A NAME="12:22">12:22</A><DD>For Jehovah will not cast away his people for his great name's sake; because it has pleased Jehovah to make you his people.
<DT><A NAME="12:23">12:23</A><DD>Moreover, as for me, far be it from me that I should sin against Jehovah in ceasing to pray for you; and I will teach you the good and right way.
<DT><A NAME="12:24">12:24</A><DD>Only, fear Jehovah, and serve him in truth, with all your heart; for see how great things he has done <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1sa?n=12:24">for</A> you.
<DT><A NAME="12:25">12:25</A><DD>But if ye do wickedly, ye shall perish, both ye and your king.

<DT><A NAME="13:1">13:1</A><DD>Saul was <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1sa?n=13:1">...</A>. years old when he became king; and he reigned two years over Israel.
<DT><A NAME="13:2">13:2</A><DD>And Saul chose him three thousand men out of Israel: there were with Saul two thousand in Michmash and in mount Bethel, and a thousand were with <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1sa?n=13:2">Jonathan</A> in Gibeah of Benjamin; and the rest of the people he sent every man to his tent.
<DT><A NAME="13:3">13:3</A><DD>And Jonathan smote the outpost of the Philistines that was in Geba, and the Philistines heard <I>of it</I>. And Saul blew the trumpet throughout the land, saying, Let the Hebrews hear.
<DT><A NAME="13:4">13:4</A><DD>And all Israel heard say, Saul has smitten the garrison of the Philistines, and Israel also has become odious to the Philistines. And the people were called together after Saul to Gilgal.
<DT><A NAME="13:5">13:5</A><DD>And the Philistines were assembled together to fight with Israel, thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen, and people as the sand which is on the sea-shore in multitude; and they came up, and encamped in Michmash, eastward from Beth-Aven.
<DT><A NAME="13:6">13:6</A><DD>And the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait (for the people were distressed); and the people hid themselves in caves, and in thickets, and in cliffs, and in strongholds, and in pits.
<DT><A NAME="13:7">13:7</A><DD>And the Hebrews went over the Jordan into the land of Gad and Gilead. And Saul was yet in Gilgal, and all the people followed him trembling.
<DT><A NAME="13:8">13:8</A><DD>And he waited seven days, according to the set time that Samuel <I>had appointed</I>; but Samuel did not come to Gilgal; and the people were scattered from him.
<DT><A NAME="13:9">13:9</A><DD>And Saul said, Bring hither to me the burnt-offering and the peace-offerings. And he offered up the burnt-offering.
<DT><A NAME="13:10">13:10</A><DD>And it came to pass, as soon as he had ended offering up the burnt-offering, behold, Samuel came; and Saul went out to meet him, that he might <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1sa?n=13:10">salute</A> him.
<DT><A NAME="13:11">13:11</A><DD>And Samuel said, What hast thou done? And Saul said, Because I saw that the people were scattered from me, and that thou didst not come within the days appointed, and that the Philistines were assembled at Michmash,
<DT><A NAME="13:12">13:12</A><DD>I said, The Philistines will come down now upon me to Gilgal, and I have not made supplication to Jehovah; and I forced myself, and offered up the burnt-offering.
<DT><A NAME="13:13">13:13</A><DD>And Samuel said to Saul, Thou hast done foolishly: thou hast not kept the commandment of Jehovah thy God which he commanded thee; for now would Jehovah have established thy kingdom over Israel for ever.
<DT><A NAME="13:14">13:14</A><DD>But now thy kingdom shall not continue: Jehovah has sought him a man after his own heart, and Jehovah has <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1sa?n=13:14">appointed</A> him ruler over his people; for thou hast not kept what Jehovah commanded thee.
<DT><A NAME="13:15">13:15</A><DD>And Samuel arose and went up from Gilgal to Gibeah of Benjamin. And Saul numbered the people that were found with him, about six hundred men.
<DT><A NAME="13:16">13:16</A><DD>And Saul, and Jonathan his son, and the people that were found with them, abode in Geba of Benjamin; and the Philistines encamped in Michmash.
<DT><A NAME="13:17">13:17</A><DD>And the ravagers came out of the camp of the Philistines in three companies: one company turned the way of Ophrah, into the land of Shual;
<DT><A NAME="13:18">13:18</A><DD>and another company turned the way to Beth-horon; and the other company turned the way to the district that looks over the ravine of Zeboim toward the wilderness.
<DT><A NAME="13:19">13:19</A><DD>Now there was no smith found throughout the land of Israel; for the Philistines said, Lest the Hebrews make them swords or spears.
<DT><A NAME="13:20">13:20</A><DD>And all Israel went down to the Philistines, every man to get his ploughshare, and his hoe, and his axe, and his sickle sharpened,
<DT><A NAME="13:21">13:21</A><DD>when the edges of the sickles, and the hoes, and the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1sa?n=13:21">forks</A>, and the axes were blunted; and to set the goads.
<DT><A NAME="13:22">13:22</A><DD>And it came to pass in the day of battle, that there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people that were with Saul and Jonathan; but with Saul and with Jonathan his son there was found.
<DT><A NAME="13:23">13:23</A><DD>And a garrison of the Philistines went out to the passage of Michmash.
</DL></DIV><H2>Chapter 14</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="14:1">14:1</A><DD>Now it came to pass one day that Jonathan the son of Saul said to the young man that bore his armour, Come and let us go over to the Philistines' garrison which is on the other side. But he did not tell his father.
<DT><A NAME="14:2">14:2</A><DD>And Saul abode at the extreme end of Gibeah under the pomegranate-tree which <I>was</I> in Migron; and the people that were with him were about six hundred men.
<DT><A NAME="14:3">14:3</A><DD>(And Ahijah the son of Ahitub, Ichabod's brother, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eli, Jehovah's priest in Shiloh, wore the ephod.) And the people did not know that Jonathan was gone.
<DT><A NAME="14:4">14:4</A><DD>Now between the passes by which Jonathan sought to go over to the Philistines' garrison there was a sharp rock on the one side and a sharp rock on the other side; and the name of the one <I>was</I> Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh.
<DT><A NAME="14:5">14:5</A><DD>The one <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1sa?n=14:5">crag</A> <I>formed</I> a pillar on the north opposite to Michmash, and the other on the south opposite to Geba.
<DT><A NAME="14:6">14:6</A><DD>And Jonathan said to the young man that bore his armour, Come, and let us go over to the garrison of these uncircumcised: perhaps Jehovah will work for us; for there is no restraint to Jehovah to save by many or by few.
<DT><A NAME="14:7">14:7</A><DD>And his armour-bearer said to him, Do all that is in thy heart; turn thee; behold, I am with thee according to thy heart.
<DT><A NAME="14:8">14:8</A><DD>Then said Jonathan, Behold, we will pass over to the men, and we will shew ourselves to them.
<DT><A NAME="14:9">14:9</A><DD>If they say thus to us, Stand still until we come to you, then we will stay in our place, and will not go up to them.
<DT><A NAME="14:10">14:10</A><DD>And if they say thus, Come up to us, then we will go up; for Jehovah has given them into our hand; and this shall be the sign to us.
<DT><A NAME="14:11">14:11</A><DD>And both of them shewed themselves to the garrison of the Philistines; and the Philistines said, Behold, the Hebrews come forth out of the holes where they had hid themselves.
<DT><A NAME="14:12">14:12</A><DD>And the men of the garrison answered Jonathan and his armour-bearer and said, Come up to us, and we will shew you something. And Jonathan said to his armour-bearer, Come up after me; for Jehovah has delivered them into the hand of Israel.
<DT><A NAME="14:13">14:13</A><DD>And Jonathan climbed up upon his hands and upon his feet, and his armour-bearer after him; and they fell before Jonathan; and his armour-bearer slew after him.
<DT><A NAME="14:14">14:14</A><DD>And that first slaughter which Jonathan and his armour-bearer wrought was about twenty men, as it were on the half-furrow of an <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1sa?n=14:14">acre</A> of land.
<DT><A NAME="14:15">14:15</A><DD>And there was trembling in the camp, in the field, and among all the people; the garrison, and the ravagers, they also trembled, and the earth quaked; for it was a trembling <I>from</I> God.
<DT><A NAME="14:16">14:16</A><DD>And the watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked, and behold, the multitude melted away, and they went on slaying one <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1sa?n=14:16">another</A>.
<DT><A NAME="14:17">14:17</A><DD>Then said Saul to the people that were with him, Muster now, and see who is gone from us. And they mustered, and behold, Jonathan and his armour-bearer were not there.
<DT><A NAME="14:18">14:18</A><DD>And Saul said to Ahijah, Bring hither the ark of <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1sa?n=14:18">God</A>. For the ark of God was at that time with the children of Israel.
<DT><A NAME="14:19">14:19</A><DD>And it came to pass while Saul talked to the priest, that the noise which was in the camp of the Philistines went on and increased; and Saul said to the priest, Withdraw thy hand.
<DT><A NAME="14:20">14:20</A><DD>And Saul and all the people that were with him were called together, and they came to the battle; and behold, every man's sword was against his fellow, a very great confusion.
<DT><A NAME="14:21">14:21</A><DD>And there were Hebrews with the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1sa?n=14:21">Philistines</A> before that time, who had gone up with them into the camp round about; and they also <I>turned</I> to be with the Israelites who were with Saul and Jonathan.
<DT><A NAME="14:22">14:22</A><DD>And all the men of Israel who had hid themselves in mount Ephraim heard that the Philistines fled, and they also followed hard after them in the battle.
<DT><A NAME="14:23">14:23</A><DD>And Jehovah saved Israel that day; and the battle passed over beyond Beth-Aven.
<DT><A NAME="14:24">14:24</A><DD>But the men of Israel were distressed that day. Now Saul had adjured the people, saying, Cursed be the man that eateth food until evening, and <I>until</I> I am avenged on mine enemies. So none of the people tasted food.
<DT><A NAME="14:25">14:25</A><DD>And all they of the land came to a wood; and there was honey on the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1sa?n=14:25">ground</A>.
<DT><A NAME="14:26">14:26</A><DD>And the people had come into the wood, and behold, the honey flowed; but no man put his hand to his mouth, for the people feared the oath.
<DT><A NAME="14:27">14:27</A><DD>But Jonathan had not heard when his father adjured the people; and he put forth the end of his staff which was in his hand, and dipped it in the honeycomb, and put his hand to his mouth, and his eyes became bright.
<DT><A NAME="14:28">14:28</A><DD>Then answered one of the people and said, Thy father strictly adjured the people, saying, Cursed be the man that eateth food this day; and the people are <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1sa?n=14:28">faint</A>.
<DT><A NAME="14:29">14:29</A><DD>And Jonathan said, My father has troubled the land: see, I pray you, that mine eyes are bright, because I tasted a little of this honey.
<DT><A NAME="14:30">14:30</A><DD>How much more, if the people had eaten freely to-day of the spoil of their enemies which they found? for would there not now have been a much greater slaughter among the Philistines?
<DT><A NAME="14:31">14:31</A><DD>And they smote the Philistines that day from Michmash to Ajalon; and the people were very faint.
<DT><A NAME="14:32">14:32</A><DD>And the people fell on the spoil, and took sheep, and oxen, and calves, and slaughtered them on the ground; and the people ate <I>them</I> with the blood.
<DT><A NAME="14:33">14:33</A><DD>And they told Saul, saying, Behold, the people sin against Jehovah, in that they eat with the blood. And he said, Ye have acted perversely: roll me now a great stone.
<DT><A NAME="14:34">14:34</A><DD>And Saul said, Disperse yourselves among the people, and say to them, Bring near to me every man his ox, and every man his <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1sa?n=14:34">sheep</A>, and slaughter them here, and eat; and sin not against Jehovah in eating with the blood. And all the people brought every man his ox with him that night, and slaughtered <I>them</I> there.
<DT><A NAME="14:35">14:35</A><DD>And Saul built an altar to Jehovah: this was the first altar he <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1sa?n=14:35">built</A> to Jehovah.
<DT><A NAME="14:36">14:36</A><DD>And Saul said, Let us go down after the Philistines by night, and plunder them until the morning light, and let us not leave a man of them. And they said, Do whatsoever is good in thy sight. Then said the priest, Let us come near hither to God.
<DT><A NAME="14:37">14:37</A><DD>And Saul inquired of God, Shall I go down after the Philistines? wilt thou give them into the hand of Israel? But he did not answer him that day.

<DT><A NAME="14:39">14:39</A><DD>For, <I>as</I> Jehovah liveth, who has saved Israel, though it be in Jonathan my son, he shall certainly die. And no one answered him among all the people.
<DT><A NAME="14:40">14:40</A><DD>Then said he to all Israel, Be ye on one side, and I and Jonathan my son will be on the other side. And the people said to Saul, Do what is good in thy sight.
<DT><A NAME="14:41">14:41</A><DD>And Saul said to Jehovah the God of Israel, Give a perfect <I>testimony</I>! And Jonathan and Saul were taken, and the people escaped.
<DT><A NAME="14:42">14:42</A><DD>And Saul said, Cast <I>lots</I> between me and Jonathan my son. And Jonathan was taken.
<DT><A NAME="14:43">14:43</A><DD>And Saul said to Jonathan, Tell me what thou hast done. And Jonathan told him and said, With the end of the staff which is in my hand I tasted a little honey, <I>and</I> behold, I must die!
<DT><A NAME="14:44">14:44</A><DD>And Saul said, God do so <I>to me</I> and more also; thou shalt certainly die, Jonathan.

<DT><A NAME="14:46">14:46</A><DD>And Saul went up from following the Philistines; and the Philistines went to their own place.
<DT><A NAME="14:47">14:47</A><DD>And Saul took the kingdom over Israel, and fought against all his enemies round about, against Moab, and against the children of Ammon, and against Edom, and against the kings of Zobah, and against the Philistines; and whithersoever he turned himself, he discomfited <I>them</I>.
<DT><A NAME="14:48">14:48</A><DD>And he did <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1sa?n=14:48">valiantly</A>, and smote the Amalekites, and delivered Israel out of the hands of their spoilers.

<DT><A NAME="15:1">15:1</A><DD>And Samuel said to Saul, Jehovah sent *me* to anoint thee king over his people, over Israel: now therefore hearken to the voice of the words of Jehovah.
<DT><A NAME="15:2">15:2</A><DD>Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: I have considered what Amalek did to Israel, how he set himself against him in the way, when he came up from Egypt.
<DT><A NAME="15:3">15:3</A><DD>Now go and smite Amalek, and destroy utterly all that they have, and spare them not, but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass.
<DT><A NAME="15:4">15:4</A><DD>And Saul summoned the people, and numbered them in Telaim, two hundred thousand footmen, and ten thousand men of Judah.
<DT><A NAME="15:5">15:5</A><DD>And Saul came to the city of the Amalekites, and set an ambush in the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1sa?n=15:5">valley</A>.
<DT><A NAME="15:6">15:6</A><DD>And Saul said to the Kenites, Go, depart, and go down from among the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them; for ye shewed kindness to all the children of Israel when they came up out of Egypt. And the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites.
<DT><A NAME="15:7">15:7</A><DD>And Saul smote Amalek from Havilah as thou comest to Shur, which is opposite to Egypt.
<DT><A NAME="15:8">15:8</A><DD>And he took Agag the king of Amalek alive, and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword.
<DT><A NAME="15:9">15:9</A><DD>And Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best of the sheep and oxen, and beasts of the second <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1sa?n=15:9">bearing</A>, and the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1sa?n=15:9a">lambs</A>, and all that was good, and would not devote them to destruction; but everything that was mean and weak, that they destroyed utterly.
<DT><A NAME="15:10">15:10</A><DD>And the word of Jehovah came to Samuel, saying,
<DT><A NAME="15:11">15:11</A><DD>It repenteth me that I have set up Saul to be king; for he is turned away from following me, and hath not fulfilled my words. And Samuel was much grieved; and he cried to Jehovah all night.
<DT><A NAME="15:12">15:12</A><DD>And Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning. And it was told Samuel, saying, Saul came to <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1sa?n=15:12">Carmel</A>, and behold, he set him up a <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1sa?n=15:12a">monument</A>, and has turned about, and passed on, and gone down to Gilgal.
<DT><A NAME="15:13">15:13</A><DD>And Samuel came to Saul; and Saul said to him, Blessed art thou of Jehovah: I have fulfilled the word of Jehovah.
<DT><A NAME="15:14">15:14</A><DD>And Samuel said, What <I>means</I> then this bleating of sheep in mine ears, and the lowing of oxen which I hear?
<DT><A NAME="15:15">15:15</A><DD>And Saul said, They have brought them from the Amalekites, because the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen, to sacrifice to Jehovah thy God; and the rest we have utterly destroyed.
<DT><A NAME="15:16">15:16</A><DD>And Samuel said to Saul, Stay, that I may tell thee what Jehovah has said to me this night. And he said to him, Say on.
<DT><A NAME="15:17">15:17</A><DD>And Samuel said, Was it not when thou wast little in thine eyes that thou <I>becamest</I> the head of the tribes of Israel, and Jehovah anointed thee king over Israel?
<DT><A NAME="15:18">15:18</A><DD>And Jehovah sent thee on a way and said, Go and utterly destroy the sinners the Amalekites, and fight against them until they be consumed.
<DT><A NAME="15:19">15:19</A><DD>Why then didst thou not hearken to the voice of Jehovah, but didst fall upon the spoil, and didst evil in the sight of Jehovah?
<DT><A NAME="15:20">15:20</A><DD>And Saul said to Samuel, I have indeed hearkened to the voice of Jehovah, and have gone the way which Jehovah sent me, and have brought Agag the king of Amalek, and have utterly destroyed the Amalekites.
<DT><A NAME="15:21">15:21</A><DD>But the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1sa?n=15:21">choicest</A> of the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1sa?n=15:21a">devoted</A> things, to sacrifice to Jehovah thy God in Gilgal.
<DT><A NAME="15:22">15:22</A><DD>And Samuel said, Has Jehovah delight in burnt-offerings and sacrifices, As in hearkening to the voice of Jehovah? Behold, <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1sa?n=15:22">obedience</A> is better than sacrifice, Attention than the fat of rams.
<DT><A NAME="15:23">15:23</A><DD>For rebellion is <I>as</I> the sin of divination, And selfwill is <I>as</I> iniquity and <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1sa?n=15:23">idolatry</A>. Because thou hast rejected the word of Jehovah, He hath also rejected thee from being king.
<DT><A NAME="15:24">15:24</A><DD>And Saul said to Samuel, I have sinned, for I have transgressed the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1sa?n=15:24">commandment</A> of Jehovah, and thy words; for I feared the people, and hearkened to their voice.
<DT><A NAME="15:25">15:25</A><DD>And now, I pray thee, forgive my sin, and turn again with me, that I may worship Jehovah.
<DT><A NAME="15:26">15:26</A><DD>And Samuel said to Saul, I will not turn again with thee; for thou hast rejected the word of Jehovah, and Jehovah has rejected thee from being king over Israel.
<DT><A NAME="15:27">15:27</A><DD>And as Samuel turned to go away, <I>Saul</I> laid hold upon the skirt of his mantle, and it rent.
<DT><A NAME="15:28">15:28</A><DD>Then Samuel said to him, Jehovah has rent the kingdom of Israel from thee to-day, and has given it to thy neighbour, who is better than thou.
<DT><A NAME="15:29">15:29</A><DD>And also the Hope of Israel will not lie nor repent; for he is not a man, that he should repent.
<DT><A NAME="15:30">15:30</A><DD>And he said, I have sinned; honour me now, I pray thee, before the elders of my people, and before Israel, and turn again with me, that I may worship Jehovah thy God.
<DT><A NAME="15:31">15:31</A><DD>So Samuel turned again after Saul; and Saul worshipped Jehovah.
<DT><A NAME="15:32">15:32</A><DD>And Samuel said, Bring ye near to me Agag the king of Amalek. And Agag came to him <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1sa?n=15:32">gaily</A>. And Agag said, Surely the bitterness of death is past.
<DT><A NAME="15:33">15:33</A><DD>And Samuel said, As thy sword has made women childless, so shall thy mother be childless <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1sa?n=15:33">above</A> women. And Samuel hewed Agag in pieces before Jehovah in Gilgal.
<DT><A NAME="15:34">15:34</A><DD>And Samuel went to Ramah; and Saul went up to his house to Gibeah of Saul.
<DT><A NAME="15:35">15:35</A><DD>And Samuel saw Saul no more until the day of his death; for Samuel mourned over Saul; <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1sa?n=15:35">and</A> Jehovah repented that he had made Saul king over Israel.
</DL></DIV><H2>Chapter 16</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="16:1">16:1</A><DD>And Jehovah said to Samuel, How long wilt thou mourn for Saul, seeing I have rejected him from reigning over Israel? fill thy horn with oil, and go, I will send thee to Jesse the Bethlehemite; for I have provided me a king among his sons.
<DT><A NAME="16:2">16:2</A><DD>And Samuel said, How shall I go? if Saul hear <I>it</I>, he will kill me. And Jehovah said, Take a heifer with thee, and say, I am come to sacrifice to Jehovah.
<DT><A NAME="16:3">16:3</A><DD>And call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will tell thee what thou shalt do; and thou shalt anoint unto me him whom I <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1sa?n=16:3">name</A> unto thee.
<DT><A NAME="16:4">16:4</A><DD>And Samuel did what Jehovah said, and came to Bethlehem. And the elders of the city came trembling to meet <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1sa?n=16:4">him</A>, and said, Dost thou come peaceably?
<DT><A NAME="16:5">16:5</A><DD>And he said, Peaceably: I am come to sacrifice to Jehovah. Hallow yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice. And he hallowed Jesse and his sons, and called them to the sacrifice.
<DT><A NAME="16:6">16:6</A><DD>And it came to pass when they were come, that he looked on Eliab, and said, Surely Jehovah's anointed is before him.
<DT><A NAME="16:7">16:7</A><DD>But Jehovah said to Samuel, Look not on his <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1sa?n=16:7">countenance</A>, or on the height of his stature; because I have rejected him; for it is not as man seeth; for man looketh upon the outward <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1sa?n=16:7a">appearance</A>, but Jehovah looketh upon the heart.
<DT><A NAME="16:8">16:8</A><DD>Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel. And he said, Neither has Jehovah chosen this one.
<DT><A NAME="16:9">16:9</A><DD>Then Jesse made Shammah pass by. And he said, Neither has Jehovah chosen this one.
<DT><A NAME="16:10">16:10</A><DD>And Jesse made seven of his sons pass before Samuel. And Samuel said to Jesse, Jehovah has not chosen these.
<DT><A NAME="16:11">16:11</A><DD>And Samuel said to Jesse, Are these all the young men? And he said, There is yet the youngest remaining, and behold, he is feeding the sheep. And Samuel said to Jesse, Send and fetch him; for we will not sit at table till he come hither.
<DT><A NAME="16:12">16:12</A><DD>And he sent and brought him in. And he was ruddy, and besides of a lovely <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1sa?n=16:12">countenance</A> and beautiful appearance. And Jehovah said, Arise, anoint him; for this is he.
<DT><A NAME="16:13">16:13</A><DD>And Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst of his brethren. And the Spirit of Jehovah came upon <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1sa?n=16:13">David</A> from that day forward. And Samuel rose up, and went to Ramah.
<DT><A NAME="16:14">16:14</A><DD>And the Spirit of Jehovah departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from Jehovah troubled him.
<DT><A NAME="16:15">16:15</A><DD>And Saul's servants said to him, Behold now, an evil spirit <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1sa?n=16:15">from</A> God troubles thee.
<DT><A NAME="16:16">16:16</A><DD>Let our lord now speak; thy servants are before thee: they shall seek out a man, a skilful player on a harp; and it shall come to pass, when the evil spirit from God is upon thee, that he shall play with his hand, and thou shalt be well.
<DT><A NAME="16:17">16:17</A><DD>And Saul said to his servants, Provide me now a man that can play well, and bring him to me.
<DT><A NAME="16:18">16:18</A><DD>And one of the young men answered and said, Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite, who is skilled in playing, and he is a valiant man and a man of war, and skilled in speech, and of good presence, and Jehovah is with him.
<DT><A NAME="16:19">16:19</A><DD>Then Saul sent messengers to Jesse and said, Send me David thy son, who is with the sheep.
<DT><A NAME="16:20">16:20</A><DD>And Jesse took an ass with bread, and a flask of wine, and a kid, and sent <I>them</I> by David his son to Saul.
<DT><A NAME="16:21">16:21</A><DD>And David came to Saul, and stood before him; and he loved him greatly; and he became his armour-bearer.
<DT><A NAME="16:22">16:22</A><DD>And Saul sent to Jesse, saying, Let David, I pray thee, stand before me; for he has found favour in my sight.
<DT><A NAME="16:23">16:23</A><DD>And it came to pass, when the <I>evil</I> spirit from God was upon Saul, that David took the harp, and played with his hand; and Saul was refreshed, and was well, and the evil spirit departed from him.

<DT><A NAME="17:1">17:1</A><DD>And the Philistines assembled their <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1sa?n=17:1">armies</A> to battle, and were gathered together at Sochoh, which belongs to Judah, and encamped between Sochoh and Azekah, in Ephesdammim.
<DT><A NAME="17:2">17:2</A><DD>And Saul and the men of Israel were gathered together, and encamped in the valley of terebinths, and set the battle in array against the Philistines.
<DT><A NAME="17:3">17:3</A><DD>And the Philistines stood <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1sa?n=17:3">on</A> the mountain on the one side, and Israel stood <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1sa?n=17:3">on</A> the mountain on the other side; and the ravine was between them.
<DT><A NAME="17:4">17:4</A><DD>And there went out a <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1sa?n=17:4">champion</A> from the camp of the Philistines, named Goliath, of Gath, whose height was six cubits and a span.

<DT><A NAME="17:7">17:7</A><DD>And the shaft of his spear was like a weaver's beam; and his spear's head weighed six hundred shekels of iron; and the shield-bearer went before him.

<DT><A NAME="19:4">19:4</A><DD>And Jonathan spoke good of David to Saul his father, and said to him, Let not the king sin against his servant, against David, because he has not sinned against thee; for also what he did was very advantageous to thee;

<DT><A NAME="21:7">21:7</A><DD>(Now a certain man of the servants of Saul was there that day, detained before Jehovah; and his name was Doeg, the Edomite, chief of the shepherds that <I>belonged</I> to Saul.)
<DT><A NAME="21:8">21:8</A><DD>And David said to Ahimelech, And is there not here under thy hand spear or sword? for I have neither brought my sword nor my weapons with me, for the king's business was urgent.
<DT><A NAME="21:9">21:9</A><DD>And the priest said, The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom thou slewest in the valley of terebinths, behold, it is here wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod; if thou wilt take that, take it; for there is no other save that here. And David said, There is none like that: give it me.

<DT><A NAME="21:12">21:12</A><DD>And David took to heart these words, and was much afraid of Achish the king of Gath.
<DT><A NAME="21:13">21:13</A><DD>And he changed his behaviour before them, and feigned himself mad in their hands, and scratched on the doors of the gate, and let his spittle fall down on his beard.
<DT><A NAME="21:14">21:14</A><DD>And Achish said to his servants, Behold, ye see the man is mad: why did ye bring him to me?
<DT><A NAME="21:15">21:15</A><DD>have I lack of madmen, that ye have brought this one to rave in my presence? shall this <I>man</I> come into my house?

<DT><A NAME="22:1">22:1</A><DD>And David departed thence, and escaped to the cave of Adullam. And his brethren and all his father's house heard <I>it</I>, and they went down thither to him.
<DT><A NAME="22:2">22:2</A><DD>And every one in distress, and every one that was in debt, and every one of embittered <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1sa?n=22:2">spirit</A> collected round him; and he became a captain over them; and there were with him about four hundred men.
<DT><A NAME="22:3">22:3</A><DD>And David went thence to Mizpeh in Moab, and said to the king of Moab, Let my father and my mother, I pray thee, come forth amongst you, till I know what God will do for me.
<DT><A NAME="22:4">22:4</A><DD>And he brought them before the king of Moab; and they abode with him all the while that David was in the stronghold.
<DT><A NAME="22:5">22:5</A><DD>And the prophet Gad said to David, Abide not in the stronghold; depart, and go into the land of Judah. Then David departed, and came into the forest of Hareth.
<DT><A NAME="22:6">22:6</A><DD>And Saul heard that David was discovered, and the men that were with him. Now Saul was sitting in Gibeah under the tamarisk upon the height, having his spear in his hand, and all his servants were standing by him.
<DT><A NAME="22:7">22:7</A><DD>Then Saul said to his servants that stood by him, Hear now, ye Benjaminites: will the son of Jesse give every one of you also fields and vineyards? Will he make you all captains of thousands and captains of hundreds,
<DT><A NAME="22:8">22:8</A><DD>that all of you have conspired against me, and there is none that informs me when my son has made <I>a covenant</I> with the son of Jesse; and there is none of you that is sorry for me, or informs me that my son has stirred up my servant as a lier-in-wait against me, as at this day?
<DT><A NAME="22:9">22:9</A><DD>Then answered Doeg the Edomite, who was set over the servants of Saul, and said, I saw the son of Jesse coming to Nob, to Ahimelech the son of Ahitub.

<DT><A NAME="22:12">22:12</A><DD>And Saul said, Hear now, son of Ahitub. And he answered, Here I am, my lord.
<DT><A NAME="22:13">22:13</A><DD>And Saul said to him, Why have ye conspired against me, thou and the son of Jesse, in that thou hast given him bread, and a sword, and hast inquired of God for him, that he should rise against me as a lier-in-wait, as at this day?
<DT><A NAME="22:14">22:14</A><DD>And Ahimelech answered the king and said, And who is so faithful among all thy servants as David, who is the king's son-in-law, and has access to thy secret <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1sa?n=22:14">council</A>, and is honourable in thy house?
<DT><A NAME="22:15">22:15</A><DD>Was it to-day that I began to inquire of God for him? be it far from me: let not the king charge anything to his servant, <I>nor</I> to all the house of my father; for thy servant knew nothing of all this, less or more.
<DT><A NAME="22:16">22:16</A><DD>And the king said, Thou shalt certainly die, Ahimelech, thou, and all thy father's house.
<DT><A NAME="22:17">22:17</A><DD>And the king said to the couriers that stood about him, Turn and put the priests of Jehovah to death; because their hand also is with David, and because they knew when he fled, and did not inform me. But the servants of the king were not willing to put forth their hand to fall on the priests of Jehovah.
<DT><A NAME="22:18">22:18</A><DD>And the king said to Doeg, Turn thou, and fall on the priests. And Doeg the Edomite turned, and fell on the priests, and put to death that day eighty-five persons who wore the linen ephod.
<DT><A NAME="22:19">22:19</A><DD>And Nob, the city of the priests, he smote with the edge of the sword, both men and women, infants and sucklings, and oxen, and asses, and sheep, with the edge of the sword.

<DT><A NAME="23:3">23:3</A><DD>But David's men said to him, Behold, we are afraid here in Judah; how much more then if we go to Keilah against the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1sa?n=23:3">armies</A> of the Philistines?
<DT><A NAME="23:4">23:4</A><DD>And David inquired of Jehovah yet again. And Jehovah answered him and said, Arise, go down to Keilah; for I will give the Philistines into thy hand.
<DT><A NAME="23:5">23:5</A><DD>And David and his men went to Keilah, and fought against the Philistines, and brought away their cattle, and smote them with a great slaughter. So David saved the inhabitants of Keilah.
<DT><A NAME="23:6">23:6</A><DD>And it came to pass, when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled to David to Keilah, he came down with an ephod in his hand.

<DT><A NAME="23:13">23:13</A><DD>Then David and his men, about six hundred, arose and departed out of Keilah, and went whithersoever they could go. And it was told Saul that David had escaped from Keilah, and he forbore to go forth.
<DT><A NAME="23:14">23:14</A><DD>And David abode in the wilderness in strongholds, and abode in the mountain in the wilderness of Ziph. And Saul sought him every day, but God did not give him into his hand.

<DT><A NAME="25:17">25:17</A><DD>And now know and consider what thou wilt do, for evil is determined against our master, and against all his household; and he is such a son of Belial, that one cannot speak to him.
<DT><A NAME="25:18">25:18</A><DD>And Abigail made haste, and took two hundred loaves, and two skin-bottles of wine, and five sheep ready dressed, and five measures of parched <I>corn</I>, and a hundred raisin-cakes, and two hundred fig-cakes, and laid them on asses.
<DT><A NAME="25:19">25:19</A><DD>And she said to her young men, Go on before me; behold, I come after you. But she did not tell her husband Nabal.

<DT><A NAME="25:25">25:25</A><DD>Let not my lord, I pray thee, regard this man of Belial, Nabal; for as his name is, so is he: <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1sa?n=25:25">Nabal</A> is his name, and <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1sa?n=25:25a">folly</A> is with him; and I thy handmaid did not see the young men of my lord, whom thou didst send.
<DT><A NAME="25:26">25:26</A><DD>And now, my lord, <I>as</I> Jehovah liveth, and <I>as</I> thy soul liveth, seeing Jehovah has restrained thee from coming with bloodshed, and from <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1sa?n=25:26">avenging</A> thyself with thine own hand, now let thine enemies, and they that seek evil to my lord, be as Nabal.
<DT><A NAME="25:27">25:27</A><DD>And now this blessing which thy bondmaid has brought to my lord, let it be given to the young men that follow my lord.
<DT><A NAME="25:28">25:28</A><DD>I pray thee, forgive the transgression of thy handmaid: for Jehovah will certainly make my lord a lasting house; because my lord fights the battles of Jehovah, and evil has not been found in thee all thy days.
<DT><A NAME="25:29">25:29</A><DD>And if a man is risen up to pursue thee and to seek thy life, the soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of the living with Jehovah thy God; and the souls of thine enemies, them shall he sling out from the hollow of the sling.
<DT><A NAME="25:30">25:30</A><DD>And it shall come to pass, when Jehovah shall do to my lord according to all the good that he has spoken concerning thee, and shall <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1sa?n=25:30">appoint</A> thee ruler over Israel,
<DT><A NAME="25:31">25:31</A><DD>that this shall be no stumbling-block to thee, nor offence of heart for my lord, either that thou hast shed blood without cause, or that my lord has avenged himself. And when Jehovah shall deal well with my lord, then remember thy handmaid.
<DT><A NAME="25:32">25:32</A><DD>And David said to Abigail, Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Israel, who sent thee this day to meet me.
<DT><A NAME="25:33">25:33</A><DD>And blessed be thy discernment, and blessed be thou, who hast kept me this day from coming with bloodshed, and from avenging myself with mine own hand.
<DT><A NAME="25:34">25:34</A><DD>But indeed, as Jehovah the God of Israel liveth, who has restrained me from hurting thee, except thou hadst hasted and come to meet me, there had not been left to Nabal by the morning light any male.

<DT><A NAME="26:2">26:2</A><DD>And Saul arose, and went down to the wilderness of Ziph, having three thousand chosen men of Israel with him, to seek David in the wilderness of Ziph.
<DT><A NAME="26:3">26:3</A><DD>And Saul encamped in the hill of Hachilah, which faces the waste, by the way side. And David abode in the wilderness; and when he saw that Saul had come after him into the wilderness,
<DT><A NAME="26:4">26:4</A><DD>David sent out spies, and learned that Saul was certainly come.
<DT><A NAME="26:5">26:5</A><DD>And David arose and came to the place where Saul had encamped; and David beheld the place where Saul lay, and Abner the son of Ner, the captain of his host; and Saul lay within the wagon-defence, and the people were encamped round about him.
<DT><A NAME="26:6">26:6</A><DD>And David spake and said to Ahimelech the Hittite, and to Abishai the son of Zeruiah, Joab's brother, saying, Who will go down with me to Saul to the camp? And Abishai said, I will go down with thee.

<DT><A NAME="26:25">26:25</A><DD>And Saul said to David, Blessed be thou, my son David: thou shalt certainly do <I>great things</I>, and shalt certainly prevail. And David went on his way, and Saul returned to his place.

<DT><A NAME="27:6">27:6</A><DD>And Achish gave him Ziklag that day; therefore Ziklag belongs to the kings of Judah to this day.

<DT><A NAME="28:15">28:15</A><DD>And Samuel said to Saul, Why hast thou disquieted me, to bring me up? And Saul said, I am sore distressed; for the Philistines make war against me, and God is departed from me, and answers me no more, neither by prophets nor by dreams; therefore I have called thee, that thou mayest make known to me what I shall do.
<DT><A NAME="28:16">28:16</A><DD>And Samuel said, Why then dost thou inquire of me, seeing Jehovah is departed from thee, and is become thine enemy?
