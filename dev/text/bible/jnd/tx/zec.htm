<DT><A NAME="1:1">1:1</A><DD><A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_zec?n=1:1">*</A> In the eighth month, in the second year of <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_zec?n=1:1a">Darius</A>, came the word of Jehovah unto Zechariah the prophet, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo, saying,
<DT><A NAME="1:2">1:2</A><DD>Jehovah hath been very wroth with your fathers.
<DT><A NAME="1:3">1:3</A><DD>And thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Return unto me, saith Jehovah of <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_zec?n=1:3">hosts</A>, and I will return unto you, saith Jehovah of hosts.
<DT><A NAME="1:4">1:4</A><DD>Be ye not as your fathers, unto whom the former prophets cried, saying, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Turn ye now from your evil ways, and from your evil doings; but they did not hearken nor attend unto me, saith Jehovah.
<DT><A NAME="1:5">1:5</A><DD>Your fathers, where are they? and the prophets, do they live for ever?
<DT><A NAME="1:6">1:6</A><DD>But my words and my statutes, which I commanded my servants the prophets, did they not overtake your fathers? And they turned and said, Like as Jehovah of hosts <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_zec?n=1:6">thought</A> to do unto us, according to our ways and according to our doings, so hath he dealt with us.
<DT><A NAME="1:7">1:7</A><DD>Upon the four and twentieth day of the eleventh month, which is the month Shebat, in the second year of Darius, came the word of Jehovah unto Zechariah the prophet, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo, saying,
<DT><A NAME="1:8">1:8</A><DD>I saw by <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_zec?n=1:8">night</A>, and behold, a man riding upon a red horse, and he stood among the myrtle-trees that were in the low valley; and behind him were red, bay, and white horses.
<DT><A NAME="1:9">1:9</A><DD>And I said, My lord, what are these? And the angel that talked with me said unto me, I will shew thee what these are.
<DT><A NAME="1:10">1:10</A><DD>And the man that stood among the myrtle-trees answered and said, These are they whom Jehovah hath sent to walk to and fro through the earth.
<DT><A NAME="1:11">1:11</A><DD>And they answered the angel of Jehovah that stood among the myrtle-trees, and said, We have walked to and fro through the earth, and behold, all the earth sitteth still and is at rest.
<DT><A NAME="1:12">1:12</A><DD>And the angel of Jehovah answered and said, Jehovah of hosts, how long wilt thou not have mercy on Jerusalem and on the cities of Judah, against which thou hast had indignation these seventy years?
<DT><A NAME="1:13">1:13</A><DD>And Jehovah answered the angel that talked with me good words, comforting words.
<DT><A NAME="1:14">1:14</A><DD>And the angel that talked with me said unto me, Cry, saying, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: I am jealous for Jerusalem and for Zion with a great jealousy,
<DT><A NAME="1:15">1:15</A><DD>and I am wroth exceedingly with the nations that are at ease; for I was but a little wroth, and they helped forward the affliction.
<DT><A NAME="1:16">1:16</A><DD>Therefore thus saith Jehovah: I am returned to Jerusalem with mercies: my house shall be built in it, saith Jehovah of hosts, and the line shall be stretched forth upon Jerusalem.
<DT><A NAME="1:17">1:17</A><DD>Cry further, saying, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: My cities shall yet overflow <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_zec?n=1:17">with</A> prosperity, and Jehovah shall yet comfort Zion, and shall yet choose Jerusalem.
<DT><A NAME="1:18">1:18</A><DD><A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_zec?n=1:18">*</A> And I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and behold four horns.
<DT><A NAME="1:19">1:19</A><DD>And I said unto the angel that talked with me, What are these? And he said to me, These are the horns which have scattered Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem.
<DT><A NAME="1:20">1:20</A><DD>And Jehovah shewed me four <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_zec?n=1:20">craftsmen</A>.
<DT><A NAME="1:21">1:21</A><DD>And I said, What come these to do? And he spoke, saying, Those are the horns which scattered Judah, so that no man lifted up his head; but these are come to affright them, to cast out the horns of the nations, which lifted up the horn against the land of Judah to scatter it.

<DT><A NAME="2:1">2:1</A><DD>And I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and behold a man with a measuring line in his hand.
<DT><A NAME="2:2">2:2</A><DD>And I said, Whither goest thou? And he said unto me, To measure Jerusalem, to see what is the breadth thereof, and what is the length thereof.
<DT><A NAME="2:3">2:3</A><DD>And behold, the angel that talked with me went forth; and another angel went forth to meet him,
<DT><A NAME="2:4">2:4</A><DD>and said unto him, Run, speak to this young man, saying, Jerusalem shall be inhabited as towns without <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_zec?n=2:4">walls</A> for the multitude of men and cattle therein;
<DT><A NAME="2:5">2:5</A><DD>and I, saith Jehovah, I will be unto her a wall of fire round about, and will be the glory in the midst of her.
<DT><A NAME="2:6">2:6</A><DD>Ho, ho! flee from the land of the north, saith Jehovah; for I have scattered you abroad as the four winds of the heavens, saith Jehovah.
<DT><A NAME="2:7">2:7</A><DD>Ho! escape, Zion, that dwellest with the daughter of Babylon.
<DT><A NAME="2:8">2:8</A><DD>For thus saith Jehovah of hosts: After the glory, hath he sent me unto the nations that made you a spoil; for he that toucheth you toucheth the apple of his eye.
<DT><A NAME="2:9">2:9</A><DD>For behold, I will shake my hand upon them, and they shall become a spoil to those that served them: and ye shall know that Jehovah of hosts hath sent me.
<DT><A NAME="2:10">2:10</A><DD>Sing aloud and rejoice, daughter of Zion; for behold, I come, and I will dwell in the midst of thee, saith Jehovah.
<DT><A NAME="2:11">2:11</A><DD>And <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_zec?n=2:11">many</A> nations shall join themselves to Jehovah in that day, and shall be unto me for a people; and I will dwell in the midst of thee, and thou shalt know that Jehovah of hosts hath sent me unto thee.
<DT><A NAME="2:12">2:12</A><DD>And Jehovah shall inherit Judah <I>as</I> his portion in the holy land, and shall yet choose Jerusalem.
<DT><A NAME="2:13">2:13</A><DD>Let all flesh be silent before Jehovah; for he is risen <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_zec?n=2:13">up</A> out of his holy habitation.

<DT><A NAME="3:1">3:1</A><DD>And he shewed me Joshua the high priest standing before the Angel of Jehovah, and Satan standing at his right hand to resist <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_zec?n=3:1">him</A>.
<DT><A NAME="3:2">3:2</A><DD>And Jehovah said unto Satan, Jehovah rebuke thee, O Satan! Yea, Jehovah that hath chosen Jerusalem rebuke thee! Is not this a brand plucked out of the fire?
<DT><A NAME="3:3">3:3</A><DD>And Joshua was clothed with filthy garments, and stood before the Angel.
<DT><A NAME="3:4">3:4</A><DD>And he spoke and said unto those that stood before him, saying, Take away the filthy garments from off him. And unto him he said, See, I have caused thine iniquity to pass from thee, and I clothe thee with festival-robes.
<DT><A NAME="3:5">3:5</A><DD>And I said, Let them set a pure <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_zec?n=3:5">turban</A> upon his head. And they set the pure <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_zec?n=3:5">turban</A> upon his head, and clothed him with garments; and the Angel of Jehovah stood by.
<DT><A NAME="3:6">3:6</A><DD>And the Angel of Jehovah protested unto Joshua, saying,
<DT><A NAME="3:7">3:7</A><DD>Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: If thou wilt walk in my ways, and if thou wilt keep my charge, then thou shalt also judge my house, and shalt also keep my courts; and I will give thee a place to <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_zec?n=3:7">walk</A> among these that stand by.
<DT><A NAME="3:8">3:8</A><DD>Hear now, Joshua the high priest, thou and thy fellows that sit before thee -- for they are men of <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_zec?n=3:8">portent</A> -- for behold, I will bring forth my servant the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_zec?n=3:8a">Branch</A>.
<DT><A NAME="3:9">3:9</A><DD>For behold, the stone that I have laid before Joshua -- upon one stone are seven eyes; behold, I will engrave the graving thereof, saith Jehovah of hosts, and I will remove the iniquity of this land in one day.
<DT><A NAME="3:10">3:10</A><DD>In that day, saith Jehovah of hosts, shall ye invite every man his neighbour under the vine and under the fig-tree.

<DT><A NAME="4:1">4:1</A><DD>And the angel that talked with me came again, and waked me, as a man that is wakened out of his sleep.
<DT><A NAME="4:2">4:2</A><DD>And he said unto me, What seest thou? And I said, I see, and behold, a lamp-stand all of gold, with a <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_zec?n=4:2">bowl</A> upon the top of it, and its seven lamps thereon, seven <I>lamps</I> and seven <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_zec?n=4:2a">pipes</A> to the lamps, which are upon the top thereof;
<DT><A NAME="4:3">4:3</A><DD>and two olive-trees beside it, one on the right of the bowl, and the other on the left of it.
<DT><A NAME="4:4">4:4</A><DD>And I answered and spoke to the angel that talked with me, saying, What are these, my lord?
<DT><A NAME="4:5">4:5</A><DD>And the angel that talked with me answered and said unto me, Knowest thou not what these are? And I said, No, my lord.
<DT><A NAME="4:6">4:6</A><DD>And he answered and spoke unto me, saying, This is the word of Jehovah unto Zerubbabel, saying, Not by <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_zec?n=4:6">might</A>, nor by power, but by my Spirit, saith Jehovah of hosts.
<DT><A NAME="4:7">4:7</A><DD>Who art thou, O great mountain? before Zerubbabel <I>thou dost become</I> a plain; and he shall bring forth the head-stone with shoutings: Grace, grace unto it!
<DT><A NAME="4:8">4:8</A><DD>And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,

<DT><A NAME="4:10">4:10</A><DD>For who hath despised the day of small things? Yea, they shall rejoice <I>even</I> those seven -- and shall see the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel: these are the eyes of Jehovah, which run to and fro in the whole earth.
<DT><A NAME="4:11">4:11</A><DD>And I answered and said unto him, What are these two olive-trees on the right of the lamp-stand and on its left?
<DT><A NAME="4:12">4:12</A><DD>And I answered the second time and said unto him, What are the two olive-branches which are <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_zec?n=4:12">beside</A> the two golden tubes that empty the gold out of themselves?
<DT><A NAME="4:13">4:13</A><DD>And he spoke to me, saying, Knowest thou not what these are? And I said, No, my lord.

<DT><A NAME="5:3">5:3</A><DD>And he said unto me, This is the curse that goeth forth over the face of the whole <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_zec?n=5:3">land</A>: for every one that stealeth shall be cut off according to it on this side; and every one that sweareth shall be cut off according to it on that side.
