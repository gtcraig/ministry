<DT><A NAME="1:3">1:3</A><DD>concerning his Son (come of David's seed according to flesh,
<DT><A NAME="1:4">1:4</A><DD>marked out Son of God in power, according to <I>the</I> <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ro?n=1:4">Spirit</A> of <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ro?n=1:4a">holiness</A>, by resurrection of <I>the</I> <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ro?n=1:4b">dead</A>) Jesus Christ our Lord;
<DT><A NAME="1:5">1:5</A><DD>by whom we have received grace and apostleship in behalf of his name, for obedience of faith among all the nations,
<DT><A NAME="1:6">1:6</A><DD>among whom are *ye* also <I>the</I> <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ro?n=1:6">called</A> of Jesus Christ:
<DT><A NAME="1:7">1:7</A><DD>to all that are in Rome, beloved of God, <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ro?n=1:7">called</A> saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father and <I>our</I> Lord Jesus Christ.
<DT><A NAME="1:8">1:8</A><DD>First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that your faith is proclaimed in the whole world.
<DT><A NAME="1:9">1:9</A><DD>For God is my witness, whom I serve in my spirit in the glad tidings of his Son, how unceasingly I make mention of you,
<DT><A NAME="1:10">1:10</A><DD>always beseeching at my prayers, if any way now at least I may be <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ro?n=1:10">prospered</A> by the will of God to come to you.
<DT><A NAME="1:11">1:11</A><DD>For I greatly desire to see you, that I may impart to you some spiritual gift to establish you;
<DT><A NAME="1:12">1:12</A><DD>that is, to have mutual comfort among you, each by the faith <I>which is</I> in the other, both yours and mine.
<DT><A NAME="1:13">1:13</A><DD>But I do not wish you to be ignorant, brethren, that I often proposed to come to you, (and have been hindered until the present time,) that I might have some fruit among you too, even as among the other nations also.
<DT><A NAME="1:14">1:14</A><DD>I am a debtor both to Greeks and barbarians, both to wise and unintelligent:
<DT><A NAME="1:15">1:15</A><DD>so, as far as depends on me, am I ready to announce the glad tidings to you also who <I>are</I> in Rome.
<DT><A NAME="1:16">1:16</A><DD>For I am not ashamed of the glad tidings; for it is God's power to salvation, to every one that believes, both to Jew first and to Greek:
<DT><A NAME="1:17">1:17</A><DD>for righteousness of <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ro?n=1:17">God</A> is revealed therein, on the principle of faith, to faith: according as it is written, But the just shall live <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ro?n=1:17a">by</A> faith.
<DT><A NAME="1:18">1:18</A><DD>For there is revealed wrath of God from <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ro?n=1:18">heaven</A> upon all impiety, and unrighteousness of men holding the truth in unrighteousness.
<DT><A NAME="1:19">1:19</A><DD>Because what <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ro?n=1:19">is</A> known of God is manifest among them, for God has manifested <I>it</I> to them,
<DT><A NAME="1:20">1:20</A><DD>-- for from <I>the</I> world's creation the invisible things of him are perceived, being apprehended by the mind through the things that are made, both his eternal power and <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ro?n=1:20">divinity</A>, -- so as to <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ro?n=1:20a">render</A> them inexcusable.
<DT><A NAME="1:21">1:21</A><DD><A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ro?n=1:21">Because</A>, knowing God, they glorified <I>him</I> not as God, neither were thankful; but fell into folly in their <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ro?n=1:21a">thoughts</A>, and their heart without understanding was darkened:
<DT><A NAME="1:22">1:22</A><DD>professing themselves to be wise, they became fools,
<DT><A NAME="1:23">1:23</A><DD>and changed the glory of the incorruptible God into <I>the</I> likeness of an image of corruptible man and of birds and quadrupeds and reptiles.
<DT><A NAME="1:24">1:24</A><DD>Wherefore God gave them up <I>also</I> in the lusts of their hearts to uncleanness, to dishonour their bodies between themselves:
<DT><A NAME="1:25">1:25</A><DD><A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ro?n=1:25">who</A> changed the truth of God into falsehood, and honoured and served the creature more than him who had created <I>it</I>, who is blessed for ever. Amen.
<DT><A NAME="1:26">1:26</A><DD>For this reason God gave them up to vile lusts; for both their females changed the natural use into that contrary to nature;
<DT><A NAME="1:27">1:27</A><DD>and in like manner the males also, leaving the natural use of the female, were inflamed in their lust towards one another; males with males working shame, and receiving in themselves the recompense of their error which was fit.
<DT><A NAME="1:28">1:28</A><DD>And according as they did not think <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ro?n=1:28">good</A> to have God in <I>their</I> knowledge, God gave them up to a <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ro?n=1:28a">reprobate</A> mind to practise unseemly things;
<DT><A NAME="1:29">1:29</A><DD>being filled with all unrighteousness, wickedness, covetousness, malice; full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, evil dispositions; whisperers,
<DT><A NAME="1:30">1:30</A><DD>back-biters, hateful to <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ro?n=1:30">God</A>, insolent, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,
<DT><A NAME="1:31">1:31</A><DD>void of understanding, faithless, without natural affection, unmerciful;
<DT><A NAME="1:32">1:32</A><DD><A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ro?n=1:32">who</A> knowing the righteous <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ro?n=1:32a">judgment</A> of God, that they who <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ro?n=1:32b">do</A> such things are worthy of death, not only <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ro?n=1:32c">practise</A> them, but have fellow <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ro?n=1:32d">delight</A> in those who do <I>them</I>.
</DL></DIV><H2>Chapter 2</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="2:1">2:1</A><DD>Therefore thou art inexcusable, O man, every one who judgest, for in that in which thou judgest another, thou <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ro?n=2:1">condemnest</A> thyself; for thou that judgest doest the same things.
<DT><A NAME="2:2">2:2</A><DD>But we know that the judgment of God is according to truth upon those who do such things.
<DT><A NAME="2:3">2:3</A><DD>And thinkest thou this, O man, who judgest those that do such things, and practisest them <I>thyself</I>, that *thou* shalt escape the judgment of God?
<DT><A NAME="2:4">2:4</A><DD>or despisest thou the riches of his goodness, and forbearance, and long-suffering, not knowing that the goodness of God leads thee to repentance?
<DT><A NAME="2:5">2:5</A><DD>but, according to thy hardness and impenitent heart, treasurest up to thyself wrath, in <I>the</I> day of wrath and revelation of <I>the</I> righteous judgment of God,
<DT><A NAME="2:6">2:6</A><DD>who shall render to each according to his works:
<DT><A NAME="2:7">2:7</A><DD>to them who, in patient continuance of good <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ro?n=2:7">works</A>, seek for glory and honour and <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ro?n=2:7a">incorruptibility</A>, life eternal.
<DT><A NAME="2:8">2:8</A><DD>But to those that are contentious, and are disobedient to the truth, but obey unrighteousness, <I>there shall be</I> wrath and indignation,
<DT><A NAME="2:9">2:9</A><DD>tribulation and distress, on every soul of man that works evil, both of Jew first, and of Greek;
<DT><A NAME="2:10">2:10</A><DD>but glory and honour and peace to every one that works good, both to Jew first and to Greek:
<DT><A NAME="2:11">2:11</A><DD>for there is no acceptance of persons with God.
<DT><A NAME="2:12">2:12</A><DD>For as many as have sinned without law shall perish also without law; and as many as have sinned under law shall be judged by law,
<DT><A NAME="2:13">2:13</A><DD>(for not the hearers of the law <I>are</I> just before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified.
<DT><A NAME="2:14">2:14</A><DD>For when <I>those of the</I> nations, which have no law, practise by nature the things of the law, these, having no law, are a law to themselves;
<DT><A NAME="2:15">2:15</A><DD><A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ro?n=2:15">who</A> shew the work of the law <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ro?n=2:15a">written</A> in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and their thoughts accusing or else excusing themselves between themselves;)
<DT><A NAME="2:16">2:16</A><DD>in <I>the</I> day when God shall judge the secrets of men, according to my glad tidings, by Jesus Christ.
<DT><A NAME="2:17">2:17</A><DD>But if *thou* art named a Jew, and restest in the law, and makest thy boast in God,
<DT><A NAME="2:18">2:18</A><DD>and knowest the will, and discerningly approvest the things that are more excellent, being instructed out of the law;
<DT><A NAME="2:19">2:19</A><DD>and hast confidence that thou thyself art a leader of the blind, a light of those who <I>are</I> in darkness,
<DT><A NAME="2:20">2:20</A><DD>an instructor of the foolish, a teacher of babes, having the form of knowledge and of truth in the law:
<DT><A NAME="2:21">2:21</A><DD>thou then that teachest another, dost thou not teach thyself? thou that preachest not to steal, dost thou steal?
<DT><A NAME="2:22">2:22</A><DD>thou that sayest <I>man should</I> not commit adultery, dost thou commit adultery? thou that abhorrest idols, dost thou commit <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ro?n=2:22">sacrilege</A>?
<DT><A NAME="2:23">2:23</A><DD>thou who boastest in law, dost thou by transgression of the law dishonour God?
<DT><A NAME="2:24">2:24</A><DD>For the name of God is blasphemed on your account among the nations, according as it is <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ro?n=2:24">written</A>.
<DT><A NAME="2:25">2:25</A><DD>For circumcision indeed profits if thou keep <I>the</I> law; but if thou be a law-transgressor, thy circumcision is become uncircumcision.
<DT><A NAME="2:26">2:26</A><DD>If therefore the uncircumcision keep the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ro?n=2:26">requirements</A> of the law, shall not his uncircumcision be <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ro?n=2:26a">reckoned</A> for circumcision,
<DT><A NAME="2:27">2:27</A><DD>and uncircumcision by nature, fulfilling the law, judge thee, who, <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ro?n=2:27">with</A> letter and circumcision, <I>art</I> a law-transgressor?
<DT><A NAME="2:28">2:28</A><DD>For he is not a Jew who <I>is</I> one <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ro?n=2:28">outwardly</A>, neither that circumcision which is outward in flesh;
<DT><A NAME="2:29">2:29</A><DD>but he <I>is</I> a Jew <I>who is so</I> <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ro?n=2:29">inwardly</A>; and circumcision, of the heart, in spirit, not in letter; whose praise <I>is</I> not of men, but of God.

<DT><A NAME="3:1">3:1</A><DD>What then <I>is</I> the superiority of the Jew? or what the profit of circumcision?
<DT><A NAME="3:2">3:2</A><DD>Much every way: and first, indeed, that to them were entrusted the oracles of God.
<DT><A NAME="3:3">3:3</A><DD>For what? if some have not believed, shall their unbelief make the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ro?n=3:3">faith</A> of God of none effect?
<DT><A NAME="3:4">3:4</A><DD>Far be the thought: but let God be true, and every man false; according as it is <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ro?n=3:4">written</A>, So that thou shouldest be justified in thy words, and shouldest overcome when thou art in judgment.
<DT><A NAME="3:5">3:5</A><DD>But if our unrighteousness commend God's righteousness, what shall we say? Is God unrighteous who inflicts <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ro?n=3:5">wrath</A>? I speak according to man.
<DT><A NAME="3:6">3:6</A><DD>Far be the thought: since how shall God judge the world?
<DT><A NAME="3:7">3:7</A><DD>For if the truth of God, in my lie, has more <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ro?n=3:7">abounded</A> to his glory, why yet am *I* also judged as a sinner?
<DT><A NAME="3:8">3:8</A><DD>and not, according as we are injuriously charged, and according as some affirm that we say, Let us practise evil things, that good ones may come? whose judgment is just.
<DT><A NAME="3:9">3:9</A><DD>What then? are we better? No, in no wise: for we have before charged both Jews and Greeks with being all under sin:
<DT><A NAME="3:10">3:10</A><DD>according as it is written, There is not a righteous <I>man</I>, not even one;
<DT><A NAME="3:11">3:11</A><DD>there is not the <I>man</I> that understands, there is not one that seeks after God.
<DT><A NAME="3:12">3:12</A><DD>All have gone out of the way, they have together become unprofitable; there is not one that practises goodness, there is not so much as <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ro?n=3:12">one</A>:

<DT><A NAME="3:19">3:19</A><DD>Now we know that whatever the things the law says, it speaks to those <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ro?n=3:19">under</A> the law, that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ro?n=3:19a">be</A> under judgment to God.

<DT><A NAME="3:22">3:22</A><DD>righteousness of God by faith of Jesus Christ towards all, and upon all those who believe: for there is no difference;
<DT><A NAME="3:23">3:23</A><DD>for all have sinned, and come <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ro?n=3:23">short</A> of the glory of God;

<DT><A NAME="3:25">3:25</A><DD>whom God has set forth a <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ro?n=3:25">mercy-seat</A>, through faith in his blood, for <I>the</I> shewing forth of his righteousness, in respect of the passing <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ro?n=3:25a">by</A> the sins that had taken place before, through the forbearance of God;
<DT><A NAME="3:26">3:26</A><DD>for <I>the</I> shewing forth of his righteousness in the present time, so that he should be just, and justify him that is of <I>the</I> faith of Jesus.
