<DT><A NAME="1:2">1:2</A><DD>Hear, ye peoples, all of you; hearken, O earth, and all that is therein: and let the Lord Jehovah be witness against you, the Lord from his holy temple!
<DT><A NAME="1:3">1:3</A><DD>For behold, Jehovah cometh forth out of his place, and will come down, and tread upon the high places of the earth.
<DT><A NAME="1:4">1:4</A><DD>And the mountains shall be melted under him, and the valleys shall be cleft, as wax before the fire, as waters poured down a steep place.
<DT><A NAME="1:5">1:5</A><DD>For the transgression of Jacob is all this, and for the sins of the house of Israel. Whence is the transgression of Jacob? is it not <I>from</I> Samaria? And whence are the high places of Judah? are they not <I>from</I> Jerusalem?
<DT><A NAME="1:6">1:6</A><DD>Therefore will I make Samaria as a heap of the field, as plantings of a vineyard; and I will pour down the stones thereof into the valley, and I will lay bare the foundations thereof.
<DT><A NAME="1:7">1:7</A><DD>And all her graven images shall be beaten to pieces, and all her harlot-gifts shall be burned with fire, and all her idols will I make a desolation; for of the hire of a harlot hath she gathered <I>them</I>, and to a harlot's hire shall they return.
<DT><A NAME="1:8">1:8</A><DD>For this will I lament, and I will howl; I will go <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mic?n=1:8">stripped</A> and naked: I will make a wailing like the jackals, and mourning like the ostriches.

<DT><A NAME="1:13">1:13</A><DD>Bind the chariot to the swift steed, O inhabitress of Lachish: she was the beginning of sin to the daughter of Zion; for in thee were found the transgressions of Israel.
<DT><A NAME="1:14">1:14</A><DD>Therefore shalt thou give parting-gifts to <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mic?n=1:14">Moresheth-Gath</A>: the houses of <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mic?n=1:14a">Achzib</A> shall be a lie to the kings of Israel.

<DT><A NAME="2:3">2:3</A><DD>Therefore thus saith Jehovah: Behold, against this family do I devise an evil, from which ye shall not remove your necks; neither shall ye walk haughtily: for it is an evil time.
<DT><A NAME="2:4">2:4</A><DD>In that day shall they take up a proverb concerning you, and lament with a doleful lamentation, <I>and</I> say, We are utterly spoiled: he hath changed the portion of my people: how hath he removed it from me! He hath distributed our fields to the rebellious.
<DT><A NAME="2:5">2:5</A><DD>Therefore thou shalt have none that shall cast the measuring line upon a lot, in the congregation of Jehovah.
<DT><A NAME="2:6">2:6</A><DD><A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mic?n=2:6">Prophesy</A> ye not, they prophesy. If they do not prophesy to <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mic?n=2:6a">these</A>, the ignominy will not depart.

<DT><A NAME="2:8">2:8</A><DD>But of late my people is risen up as an enemy: ye strip off the mantle <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mic?n=2:8">with</A> the garment from them that pass by securely, that are <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mic?n=2:8a">averse</A> from war.
<DT><A NAME="2:9">2:9</A><DD>The women of my people do ye cast out from their pleasant houses; from their young children do ye take away my magnificence for ever.
<DT><A NAME="2:10">2:10</A><DD>Arise ye, and depart; for this is not the resting-place, because of defilement <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mic?n=2:10">that</A> bringeth destruction, even a grievous destruction.
<DT><A NAME="2:11">2:11</A><DD>If a man walking in wind and falsehood do lie, <I>saying,</I> I will prophesy unto thee of wine and of strong drink, he shall be the prophet of this people.
<DT><A NAME="2:12">2:12</A><DD>I will surely assemble, O Jacob, the whole of thee; I will surely gather the remnant of Israel; I will put them together as sheep of <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mic?n=2:12">Bozrah</A>, as a flock in the midst of their pasture: they shall make great noise by reason of <I>the multitude of</I> men.
<DT><A NAME="2:13">2:13</A><DD>One that breaketh through is gone up before them: they have broken forth, and have passed on to the gate, and are gone out by it; and their king passeth on before them, and Jehovah at the head of them.

<DT><A NAME="3:1">3:1</A><DD>And I said, Hear, I pray you, ye heads of Jacob, and princes of the house of Israel: Is it not for you to know judgment?
<DT><A NAME="3:2">3:2</A><DD>Ye who hate the good, and love evil; who pluck off their skin from them, and their flesh from off their bones;
<DT><A NAME="3:3">3:3</A><DD>and who eat the flesh of my people, and flay their skin from off them, and break their bones, and chop them in pieces as for the pot, and as flesh within the cauldron.
<DT><A NAME="3:4">3:4</A><DD>Then shall they cry unto Jehovah, but he will not answer them; and he will hide his face from them at that time, according as they have wrought evil in their doings.
<DT><A NAME="3:5">3:5</A><DD>Thus saith Jehovah concerning the prophets that cause my people to err, that bite with their teeth, and cry, Peace! but whoso putteth not into their mouths they <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mic?n=3:5">prepare</A> war against him:
<DT><A NAME="3:6">3:6</A><DD>therefore ye shall have night without a vision; and it shall be dark unto you, without divination; and the sun shall go down upon the prophets, and the day shall be black over them.
<DT><A NAME="3:7">3:7</A><DD>And the seers shall be ashamed, and the diviners confounded; and they shall all cover their lips, for there will be no answer of God.
<DT><A NAME="3:8">3:8</A><DD>But truly I am filled with power by the Spirit of Jehovah, and with judgment and with might, to declare unto Jacob his transgression, and to Israel his sin.
<DT><A NAME="3:9">3:9</A><DD>Hear this, I pray you, ye heads of the house of Jacob, and princes of the house of Israel, that abhor <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mic?n=3:9">judgment</A>, and pervert all equity,

<DT><A NAME="3:11">3:11</A><DD>The heads thereof judge for reward, and the priests thereof teach for hire, and the prophets thereof divine for money; yet do they lean upon Jehovah, and say, Is not Jehovah in the midst of us? no evil shall come upon us.
<DT><A NAME="3:12">3:12</A><DD>Therefore shall Zion for your sake be ploughed <I>as</I> a field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of the house as the high places of a <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mic?n=3:12">forest</A>.

<DT><A NAME="7:3">7:3</A><DD>Both hands are for evil, to do it well. The prince asketh, and the judge <I>is there</I> for a reward; and the great <I>man</I> uttereth his soul's greed: and <I>together</I> they <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mic?n=7:3">combine</A> it.
<DT><A NAME="7:4">7:4</A><DD>The best of them is as a briar; the most upright, <I>worse</I> than a thorn-fence. The day of thy watchmen, thy visitation is come; now shall be their perplexity.
<DT><A NAME="7:5">7:5</A><DD>Believe ye not in a companion, put not confidence in a familiar friend: keep the doors of thy mouth from her that lieth in thy bosom.
<DT><A NAME="7:6">7:6</A><DD>For the son dishonoureth the father, the daughter riseth up against her mother, the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law: a man's enemies are the men of his own household.
<DT><A NAME="7:7">7:7</A><DD>But as for me, I will look unto Jehovah; I will wait for the God of my salvation: my God will hear me.
<DT><A NAME="7:8">7:8</A><DD>Rejoice not against me, O mine <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mic?n=7:8">enemy</A>: though I fall, I shall <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mic?n=7:8a">arise</A>; when I sit in darkness, Jehovah shall be a light unto me.
<DT><A NAME="7:9">7:9</A><DD>I will bear the indignation of Jehovah -- for I have sinned against him -- until he plead my cause, and execute judgment for me: he will bring me forth to the light; I shall behold his righteousness.
<DT><A NAME="7:10">7:10</A><DD>And mine enemy shall see <I>it</I>, and shame shall cover her which said unto me, Where is Jehovah thy God? Mine eyes shall behold her; now shall she be trodden down, as the mire of the streets.
<DT><A NAME="7:11">7:11</A><DD>In the day when thy walls shall be built, on that day shall the established <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mic?n=7:11">limit</A> recede.
<DT><A NAME="7:12">7:12</A><DD>In that day they shall come to thee from Assyria and the cities of <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mic?n=7:12">Egypt</A>, and from <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mic?n=7:12">Egypt</A> to the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mic?n=7:12a">river</A>, and from sea to sea, and from mountain to mountain.
<DT><A NAME="7:13">7:13</A><DD>But the land shall be desolate because of them that dwell therein, for the fruit of their doings.
<DT><A NAME="7:14">7:14</A><DD>Feed thy people with thy rod, the flock of thine inheritance, dwelling alone in the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mic?n=7:14">forest</A>, in the midst of Carmel: let them feed in Bashan and Gilead, as in the days of old.
<DT><A NAME="7:15">7:15</A><DD>-- As in the days of thy coming forth out of the land of Egypt, will I shew them marvellous things.
<DT><A NAME="7:16">7:16</A><DD>-- The nations shall see, and be ashamed for all their might: they shall lay <I>their</I> hand upon <I>their</I> mouth, their ears shall be deaf.
<DT><A NAME="7:17">7:17</A><DD>They shall lick dust like the serpent; like crawling things of the earth, they shall come trembling forth from their <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mic?n=7:17">close</A> places. They shall turn with fear to Jehovah our God, and shall be afraid because of thee.
<DT><A NAME="7:18">7:18</A><DD>Who is a ùGod like unto thee, that forgiveth iniquity, and passeth by the transgression of the remnant of his heritage? He retaineth not his anger for ever, because he delighteth in loving-kindness.
<DT><A NAME="7:19">7:19</A><DD>He will yet again have compassion on us, he will tread under foot our iniquities: and thou wilt cast all their sins into the depths of the sea.
<DT><A NAME="7:20">7:20</A><DD>Thou wilt <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mic?n=7:20">perform</A> truth to Jacob, loving-kindness to <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mic?n=7:20a">Abraham</A>, which thou hast sworn unto our fathers, from the days of old.
