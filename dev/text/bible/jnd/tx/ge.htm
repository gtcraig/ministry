<DT><A NAME="1:3">1:3</A><DD>And God said, Let there be light. And there was light.
<DT><A NAME="1:4">1:4</A><DD>And God saw the light that it was good; and God divided between the light and the darkness.
<DT><A NAME="1:5">1:5</A><DD>And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And there was evening, and there was morning -- the first <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ge?n=1:5">day</A>.
<DT><A NAME="1:6">1:6</A><DD>And God said, Let there be an expanse in the midst of the waters, and let it be a division between waters and waters.
<DT><A NAME="1:7">1:7</A><DD>And God made the expanse, and divided between the waters that are under the expanse and the waters that are above the expanse; and it was so.
<DT><A NAME="1:8">1:8</A><DD>And God called the expanse Heavens. And there was evening, and there was morning -- a second day.
<DT><A NAME="1:9">1:9</A><DD>And God said, Let the waters under the heavens be gathered together to one place, and let the dry <I>land</I> appear. And it was so.
<DT><A NAME="1:10">1:10</A><DD>And God called the dry <I>land</I> Earth, and the gathering together of the waters he called Seas. And God saw that it was good.
<DT><A NAME="1:11">1:11</A><DD>And God said, Let the earth cause grass to spring up, herb producing seed, fruit-trees yielding fruit after their kind, the seed of which is in them, on the earth. And it was so.
<DT><A NAME="1:12">1:12</A><DD>And the earth brought forth grass, herb producing seed after its kind, and trees yielding fruit, the seed of which is in them, after their kind. And God saw that it was good.

<DT><A NAME="1:19">1:19</A><DD>And there was evening, and there was morning -- a fourth day.
<DT><A NAME="1:20">1:20</A><DD>And God said, Let the waters swarm with swarms of living souls, and let fowl fly above the earth <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ge?n=1:20">in</A> the expanse of the heavens.
<DT><A NAME="1:21">1:21</A><DD>And God created the great sea <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ge?n=1:21">monsters</A>, and every living soul that moves with which the waters swarm, after their kind, and every winged fowl after its kind. And God saw that it was good.
<DT><A NAME="1:22">1:22</A><DD>And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply on the earth.
<DT><A NAME="1:23">1:23</A><DD>And there was evening, and there was morning -- a fifth day.
<DT><A NAME="1:24">1:24</A><DD>And God said, Let the earth bring forth living souls after their kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth, after their kind. And it was so.
<DT><A NAME="1:25">1:25</A><DD>And God made the beast of the earth after its kind, and the cattle after their kind, and every creeping thing of the ground after its kind. And God saw that it was good.
<DT><A NAME="1:26">1:26</A><DD>And God said, Let us make <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ge?n=1:26">man</A> in our image, after our likeness; and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the heavens, and over the cattle, and over the whole earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth on the earth.

<DT><A NAME="1:28">1:28</A><DD>And God blessed them; and God said to them, Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth, and subdue it; and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the heavens, and over every animal that <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ge?n=1:28">moveth</A> on the earth.
<DT><A NAME="1:29">1:29</A><DD>And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb producing seed that is on the whole earth, and every tree in which is the fruit of a tree producing seed: it shall be food for you;

<DT><A NAME="2:3">2:3</A><DD>And God blessed the seventh day, and hallowed it, because that on it he rested from all his work which God had created in making <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ge?n=2:3">it</A>.
<DT><A NAME="2:4">2:4</A><DD>These are the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ge?n=2:4">histories</A> of the heavens and the earth, when they were created, in the day that Jehovah <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ge?n=2:4a">Elohim</A> made earth and heavens,

<DT><A NAME="2:6">2:6</A><DD>But a mist went up from the earth, and moistened the whole surface of the ground.
<DT><A NAME="2:7">2:7</A><DD>And Jehovah Elohim formed Man, dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and Man became a living soul.
<DT><A NAME="2:8">2:8</A><DD>And Jehovah Elohim planted a garden in <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ge?n=2:8">Eden</A> eastward, and there put Man whom he had formed.
<DT><A NAME="2:9">2:9</A><DD>And out of the ground Jehovah Elohim made every tree grow that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; and the tree of life, in the midst of the garden, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.
<DT><A NAME="2:10">2:10</A><DD>And a river went out of Eden, to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became four main <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ge?n=2:10">streams</A>.
<DT><A NAME="2:11">2:11</A><DD>The name of the one is Pison: that is it which surrounds the whole land of Havilah, where the gold is.
<DT><A NAME="2:12">2:12</A><DD>And the gold of that land is good; <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ge?n=2:12">bdellium</A> and the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ge?n=2:12a">onyx</A> stone are there.
<DT><A NAME="2:13">2:13</A><DD>And the name of the second river is Gihon: that is it which surrounds the whole land of Cush.
<DT><A NAME="2:14">2:14</A><DD>And the name of the third river is <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ge?n=2:14">Hiddekel</A>: that is it which flows forward toward <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ge?n=2:14a">Asshur</A>. And the fourth river, that is Euphrates.
<DT><A NAME="2:15">2:15</A><DD>And Jehovah Elohim took Man, and put him into the garden of Eden, to till it and to guard it.
<DT><A NAME="2:16">2:16</A><DD>And Jehovah Elohim commanded Man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou shalt freely <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ge?n=2:16">eat</A>;
<DT><A NAME="2:17">2:17</A><DD>but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it; for in the day that thou eatest of it thou shalt certainly die.
<DT><A NAME="2:18">2:18</A><DD>And Jehovah Elohim said, It is not good that Man should be alone; I will make him a helpmate, his <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ge?n=2:18">like</A>.
<DT><A NAME="2:19">2:19</A><DD>And out of the ground Jehovah Elohim had formed every animal of the field and all fowl of the heavens, and brought <I>them</I> to Man, to see what he would call them; and whatever Man called each living soul, that was its name.
<DT><A NAME="2:20">2:20</A><DD>And Man gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the heavens, and to every beast of the field; but as for Adam, he found no helpmate, his <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ge?n=2:18">like</A>.
<DT><A NAME="2:21">2:21</A><DD>And Jehovah Elohim caused a deep sleep to fall upon Man; and he slept. And he took one of his ribs and closed up flesh in its stead.
<DT><A NAME="2:22">2:22</A><DD>And Jehovah Elohim built the rib that he had taken from Man into a woman; and brought her to Man.
<DT><A NAME="2:23">2:23</A><DD>And Man said, This time it is bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh: this shall be called <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ge?n=2:23">Woman</A>, because this was taken out of a <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ge?n=2:23a">man</A>.
<DT><A NAME="2:24">2:24</A><DD>Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and cleave to his wife; and they shall become one <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ge?n=2:24">flesh</A>.
<DT><A NAME="2:25">2:25</A><DD>And they were both naked, <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ge?n=2:25">Man</A> and his wife, and were not ashamed.

<DT><A NAME="3:1">3:1</A><DD>And the serpent was more crafty than any animal of the field which Jehovah Elohim had made. And it said to the woman, Is it even so, that God has said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?
<DT><A NAME="3:2">3:2</A><DD>And the woman said to the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden;
<DT><A NAME="3:3">3:3</A><DD>but of the fruit of the tree that is in the midst of the garden, God has said, Ye shall not eat of it, and ye shall not touch it, lest ye die.
<DT><A NAME="3:4">3:4</A><DD>And the serpent said to the woman, Ye will not certainly die;

<DT><A NAME="3:6">3:6</A><DD>And the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a pleasure for the eyes, and the tree was to be desired to give intelligence; and she took of its fruit, and ate, and gave also to her husband with her, and he ate.
<DT><A NAME="3:7">3:7</A><DD>And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked. And they sewed fig-leaves together, and made themselves aprons.
<DT><A NAME="3:8">3:8</A><DD>And they heard the voice of Jehovah Elohim, walking in the garden in the cool of the day. And Man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of Jehovah Elohim, in the midst of the trees of the garden.
<DT><A NAME="3:9">3:9</A><DD>And Jehovah Elohim called to Man, and said to him, Where art thou?
<DT><A NAME="3:10">3:10</A><DD>And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I feared, because I am naked; and I hid myself.
<DT><A NAME="3:11">3:11</A><DD>And he said, Who told thee that thou art naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree of which I commanded thee not to eat?
<DT><A NAME="3:12">3:12</A><DD>And Man said, The woman, whom thou hast given <I>to be</I> with me, she gave me of the tree, and I ate.
<DT><A NAME="3:13">3:13</A><DD>And Jehovah Elohim said to the woman, What is this thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent deceived me, and I ate.
<DT><A NAME="3:14">3:14</A><DD>And Jehovah Elohim said to the serpent, Because thou hast done this, be thou cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field. On thy belly shalt thou go, and eat dust all the days of thy life.
<DT><A NAME="3:15">3:15</A><DD>And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; he shall crush thy head, and thou shalt crush his heel.
<DT><A NAME="3:16">3:16</A><DD>To the woman he said, I will greatly increase thy travail and thy pregnancy; with pain thou shalt bear children; and to thy husband shall be thy desire, and he shall rule over thee.
<DT><A NAME="3:17">3:17</A><DD>And to Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened to the voice of thy wife, and eaten of the tree of which I commanded thee saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed be the ground on thy account; with toil shalt thou eat <I>of</I> it all the days of thy life;
<DT><A NAME="3:18">3:18</A><DD>and thorns and thistles shall it yield thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field.
<DT><A NAME="3:19">3:19</A><DD>In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, until thou return to the ground: for out of it wast thou taken. For dust thou art; and unto dust shalt thou return.
<DT><A NAME="3:20">3:20</A><DD>And Man called his wife's name <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ge?n=3:20">Eve</A>; because she is the mother of all living.
<DT><A NAME="3:21">3:21</A><DD>And Jehovah Elohim made Adam and his wife coats of skin, and clothed them.
<DT><A NAME="3:22">3:22</A><DD>And Jehovah Elohim said, Behold, Man is become as one of us, to know good and evil. And now, lest he stretch out his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever ...!
<DT><A NAME="3:23">3:23</A><DD>Therefore Jehovah Elohim sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from which he was taken.
<DT><A NAME="3:24">3:24</A><DD>And he drove out Man; and he set the Cherubim, and the flame of the flashing sword, toward the east of the garden of Eden, to guard the way to the tree of life.

<DT><A NAME="31:31">31:31</A><DD>And Jacob answered and said to Laban, I was afraid; for I said, Lest thou shouldest take by force thy daughters from me.
<DT><A NAME="31:32">31:32</A><DD>With whomsoever thou findest thy gods, he shall not live. Before our brethren discern what is thine with me, and take <I>it</I> to thee. But Jacob did not know that Rachel had stolen them.
<DT><A NAME="31:33">31:33</A><DD>And Laban went into Jacob's tent, and into Leah's tent, and into the two handmaids' tents, and found nothing; and he went out of Leah's tent, and entered into Rachel's tent.
<DT><A NAME="31:34">31:34</A><DD>Now Rachel had taken the teraphim and put them under the camel's saddle; and she sat upon them. And Laban explored all the tent, but found nothing.

<DT><A NAME="31:36">31:36</A><DD>And Jacob was angry, and he disputed with Laban. And Jacob answered and said to Laban, What is my fault, what my sin, that thou hast so hotly pursued after me?
<DT><A NAME="31:37">31:37</A><DD>Whereas thou hast explored all my baggage, what hast thou found of all thy household stuff? Set <I>it</I> here before my brethren and thy brethren, and let them decide between us both.
<DT><A NAME="31:38">31:38</A><DD>These twenty years have I been with thee: thy ewes and thy she-goats have not cast their young, and the rams of thy flock I have not eaten.

<DT><A NAME="31:41">31:41</A><DD>I have been these twenty years in thy house: I have served thee fourteen years for thy two daughters, and six years for thy flock; and thou hast changed my wages ten times.
<DT><A NAME="31:42">31:42</A><DD>Had not the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear of Isaac, been with me, it is certain thou wouldest have sent me away now empty.

<DT><A NAME="31:43">31:43</A><DD>And Laban answered and said to Jacob, The daughters are my daughters, and the sons are my sons, and the flock is my flock, and all that thou seest is mine; but as for my daughters, what can I do this day to them, or to their sons whom they have brought forth?
<DT><A NAME="31:44">31:44</A><DD>And now, come, let us make a covenant, I and thou; and let it be a witness between me and thee.

<DT><A NAME="31:46">31:46</A><DD>And Jacob said to his brethren, Gather stones. And they took stones, and made a heap, and ate there upon the heap.

<DT><A NAME="31:48">31:48</A><DD>And Laban said, This heap is a witness between me and thee this day. Therefore was the name of it called Galeed,
<DT><A NAME="31:49">31:49</A><DD>-- and <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ge?n=31:49">Mizpah</A>; for he said, Let Jehovah watch between me and thee, when we shall be hidden one from another:
<DT><A NAME="31:50">31:50</A><DD>if thou shouldest afflict my daughters, or if thou shouldest take wives besides my daughters, -- no man is with us; see, God is witness between me and thee!
<DT><A NAME="31:51">31:51</A><DD>And Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap, and behold the pillar which I have set up between me and thee:
<DT><A NAME="31:52">31:52</A><DD><I>let</I> this heap be witness, and the pillar a witness, that neither I pass this heap <I>to go</I> to thee, nor thou pass this heap and this pillar <I>to come</I> to me, for harm.
<DT><A NAME="31:53">31:53</A><DD>The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge between us! And Jacob swore by the fear of his father Isaac.
<DT><A NAME="31:54">31:54</A><DD>And Jacob offered a sacrifice upon the mountain, and invited his brethren to eat <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ge?n=31:54">bread</A>: and they ate bread, and lodged on the mountain.
<DT><A NAME="31:55">31:55</A><DD>And Laban rose early in the morning, and kissed his sons and his daughters, and blessed them; and Laban went and returned to his place.

<DT><A NAME="32:3">32:3</A><DD>And Jacob sent messengers before his face to Esau his brother, into the land of Seir, the fields of Edom.
<DT><A NAME="32:4">32:4</A><DD>And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye speak to my lord, to Esau: Thy servant Jacob speaks thus -- With Laban have I sojourned and tarried until now;

<DT><A NAME="32:9">32:9</A><DD>And Jacob said, God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, Jehovah, who saidst unto me: Return into thy country and to thy kindred, and I will do thee good,

<DT><A NAME="32:11">32:11</A><DD>Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau; for I fear him, lest he come and smite me, <I>and</I> the mother with the children.
<DT><A NAME="32:12">32:12</A><DD>And thou saidst, I will certainly deal well with thee, and make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.
<DT><A NAME="32:13">32:13</A><DD>And he lodged there that night; and took of what <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ge?n=32:13">came</A> to his hand a gift for Esau his brother --

<DT><A NAME="32:17">32:17</A><DD>And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother meets thee, and asks thee, saying, Whose art thou, and where goest thou, and whose are these before thee?
<DT><A NAME="32:18">32:18</A><DD>-- then thou shalt say, Thy servant Jacob's: it is a gift sent to my lord, to Esau. And behold, he also is behind us.

<DT><A NAME="32:21">32:21</A><DD>And the gift went over before him; and he himself lodged that night in the camp.

<DT><A NAME="32:26">32:26</A><DD>And he said, Let me go, for the dawn ariseth. And he said, I will not let thee go except thou bless me.

<DT><A NAME="32:28">32:28</A><DD>And he said, Thy name shall not henceforth be called Jacob, but <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ge?n=32:28">Israel</A>; for thou hast <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ge?n=32:28a">wrestled</A> with God, and with men, and hast prevailed.

<DT><A NAME="42:6">42:6</A><DD>And Joseph, he was the governor over the land -- he it was that sold <I>the corn</I> to all the people of the land. And Joseph's brethren came and bowed down to him, the face to the earth.
<DT><A NAME="42:7">42:7</A><DD>And Joseph saw his brethren, and knew them; but he made himself strange to them, and spoke roughly to them, and said to them, Whence come ye? And they said, From the land of Canaan, to buy food.
<DT><A NAME="42:8">42:8</A><DD>And Joseph knew his brethren, but they did not know him.
<DT><A NAME="42:9">42:9</A><DD>And Joseph remembered the dreams that he had dreamt of them; and he said to them, Ye are spies: to see the exposed <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ge?n=42:9">places</A> of the land ye are come.
<DT><A NAME="42:10">42:10</A><DD>And they said to him, No, my lord; but to buy food are thy servants come.
<DT><A NAME="42:11">42:11</A><DD>We are all one man's sons; we are honest: thy servants are not spies.
<DT><A NAME="42:12">42:12</A><DD>And he said to them, No; but to see the exposed places of the land are ye come.
<DT><A NAME="42:13">42:13</A><DD>And they said, Thy servants were twelve brethren, sons of one man, in the land of Canaan; and behold, the youngest is this day with our father, and one is not.
<DT><A NAME="42:14">42:14</A><DD>And Joseph said to them, That is it that I have spoken to you, saying, Ye are spies.
<DT><A NAME="42:15">42:15</A><DD>By this ye shall be put to the proof: as Pharaoh lives, ye shall not go forth hence, unless your youngest brother come hither!
<DT><A NAME="42:16">42:16</A><DD>Send one of you, that he may fetch your brother, but ye shall be imprisoned, and your words shall be put to the proof, whether the truth is in you; and if not, as Pharaoh lives, <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ge?n=42:16">ye</A> are spies.
<DT><A NAME="42:17">42:17</A><DD>And he <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ge?n=42:17">put</A> them in custody three days.
<DT><A NAME="42:18">42:18</A><DD>And Joseph said to them the third day, This do, that ye may live: I fear God.
<DT><A NAME="42:19">42:19</A><DD>If ye are honest, let one of your brethren remain bound in the house of your prison, but go ye, carry grain for the hunger of your households;
<DT><A NAME="42:20">42:20</A><DD>and bring your youngest brother to me, in order that your words be verified, and that ye may not die. And they did so.
<DT><A NAME="42:21">42:21</A><DD>Then they said one to another, We are indeed guilty concerning our brother, whose anguish of soul we saw when he besought us, and we did not hearken; therefore this distress is come upon us.
<DT><A NAME="42:22">42:22</A><DD>And Reuben answered them, saying, Did I not speak to you, saying, Do not sin against the lad? But ye did not hearken; and now behold, his blood also is required.
<DT><A NAME="42:23">42:23</A><DD>And they did not know that Joseph understood, for the interpreter was between them.
<DT><A NAME="42:24">42:24</A><DD>And he turned away from them, and wept. And he returned to them, and spoke to them, and took Simeon from among them, and bound him before their eyes.
<DT><A NAME="42:25">42:25</A><DD>And Joseph gave orders to fill their vessels with corn, and to restore every man's money into his <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ge?n=42:25">sack</A>, and to give them provision for the way. And thus did they to them.
<DT><A NAME="42:26">42:26</A><DD>And they loaded their asses with their grain, and departed thence.
<DT><A NAME="42:27">42:27</A><DD>And one of them opened his <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ge?n=42:25">sack</A> to give his ass food in the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ge?n=42:27">inn</A>, and saw his money, and behold, it was in the mouth of his <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ge?n=42:27a">sack</A>.
<DT><A NAME="42:28">42:28</A><DD>And he said to his brethren, My money is returned <I>to me</I>, and behold, it is even in my <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ge?n=42:27a">sack</A>. And their heart failed <I>them</I>, and they were afraid, saying one to another, What is this <I>that</I> God has done to us?
<DT><A NAME="42:29">42:29</A><DD>And they came into the land of Canaan, to Jacob their father, and told him all that had befallen them, saying,
<DT><A NAME="42:30">42:30</A><DD>The man, the lord of the land, spoke roughly to us, and treated us as spies of the land.
<DT><A NAME="42:31">42:31</A><DD>And we said to him, We are honest; we are not spies:
<DT><A NAME="42:32">42:32</A><DD>we are twelve brethren, sons of our father; one is not, and the youngest is this day with our father in the land of Canaan.
<DT><A NAME="42:33">42:33</A><DD>And the man, the lord of the land, said to us, Hereby shall I know that ye are honest: leave one of your brethren with me, and take <I>for</I> the hunger of your households, and go,
<DT><A NAME="42:34">42:34</A><DD>and bring your youngest brother to me, and I shall know that ye are not spies, but are honest. Your brother will I give up to you; and ye may trade in the land.
<DT><A NAME="42:35">42:35</A><DD>And it came to pass as they emptied their <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ge?n=42:25">sacks</A>, that behold, every man had his bundle of money in his <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ge?n=42:25">sack</A>; and they saw their bundles of money, they and their father, and were afraid.
<DT><A NAME="42:36">42:36</A><DD>And Jacob their father said to them, Ye have bereaved me of children: Joseph is not, and Simeon is not, and ye will take Benjamin! All these things are against me.
<DT><A NAME="42:37">42:37</A><DD>And Reuben spoke to his father, saying, Slay my two sons if I bring him not back to thee: give him into my hand, and I will bring him to thee again.
<DT><A NAME="42:38">42:38</A><DD>But he said, My son shall not go down with you, for his brother is dead, and he alone is left; and if mischief should befall him by the way in which ye go, then would ye bring down my grey hairs with sorrow to <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ge?n=42:38">Sheol</A>.

<DT><A NAME="43:1">43:1</A><DD>And the famine was grievous in the land.
<DT><A NAME="43:2">43:2</A><DD>And it came to pass, when they had finished eating the grain which they had brought from Egypt, that their father said to them, Go again, buy us a little food.
<DT><A NAME="43:3">43:3</A><DD>And Judah spoke to him, saying, The man did positively testify to us, saying, Ye shall not see my face, unless your brother be with you.
<DT><A NAME="43:4">43:4</A><DD>If thou wilt send our brother with us, we will go down and buy thee food;
<DT><A NAME="43:5">43:5</A><DD>but if thou do not send <I>him</I>, we will not go down, for the man said to us, Ye shall not see my face, unless your brother be with you.
<DT><A NAME="43:6">43:6</A><DD>And Israel said, Why did ye deal <I>so</I> ill with me <I>as</I> to tell the man whether ye had yet a brother?
<DT><A NAME="43:7">43:7</A><DD>And they said, The man asked very closely after us, and after our kindred, saying, Is your father yet alive? have ye a brother? And we told him according to the tenor of these words. Could we at all know that he would say, Bring your brother down?
<DT><A NAME="43:8">43:8</A><DD>And Judah said to Israel his father, Send the lad with me, and we will arise and go, that we may live, and not die, both we and thou and our little ones.
<DT><A NAME="43:9">43:9</A><DD>I will be surety for him: of my hand shalt thou require him; if I bring him not to thee, and set him before thy face, then shall I be guilty toward thee for ever.
<DT><A NAME="43:10">43:10</A><DD>For had we not lingered, we should now certainly have returned already twice.
<DT><A NAME="43:11">43:11</A><DD>And their father Israel said to them, If it is then so, do this: take of the best fruits <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ge?n=43:11">in</A> the land in your vessels, and carry down the man a gift: a little balsam and a little honey, <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ge?n=43:11a">tragacanth</A> and <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ge?n=43:11a">ladanum</A>, pistacia-nuts and almonds.
<DT><A NAME="43:12">43:12</A><DD>And take other money in your hand, and the money that was returned to you in the mouth of your <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ge?n=43:12">sacks</A>, carry back in your hand: perhaps it is an oversight.

<DT><A NAME="43:17">43:17</A><DD>And the man did as Joseph had said; and the man brought the men into Joseph's house.
<DT><A NAME="43:18">43:18</A><DD>And the men were afraid because they were brought into Joseph's house, and said, Because of the money that was returned to us in our sacks at the beginning are we brought in, that he may turn against us, and fall upon us and take us for bondmen, and our asses.
<DT><A NAME="43:19">43:19</A><DD>And they came up to the man that was over Joseph's house, and they spoke to him at the door of the house,
<DT><A NAME="43:20">43:20</A><DD>and said, Ah! my lord, we came indeed down at the first to buy food.
<DT><A NAME="43:21">43:21</A><DD>And it came to pass when we came to the inn, that we opened our sacks, and behold, <I>every</I> man's money was in the mouth of his sack, our money according to its weight; and we have brought it again in our hand.

<DT><A NAME="43:25">43:25</A><DD>And they made ready the gift for Joseph's coming at noon; for they had heard that they should eat bread there.
<DT><A NAME="43:26">43:26</A><DD>When Joseph came home, they brought him the gift that was in their hand, into the house, and bowed themselves to him to the earth.
<DT><A NAME="43:27">43:27</A><DD>And he asked them of their <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ge?n=43:27">welfare</A>, and said, Is your father <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ge?n=43:27a">well</A> -- the old man of whom ye spoke? Is he yet alive?

<DT><A NAME="43:29">43:29</A><DD>And he lifted up his eyes and saw his brother Benjamin, his mother's son, and said, Is this your younger brother of whom ye spoke to me? And he said, God be gracious to thee, my son!
<DT><A NAME="43:30">43:30</A><DD>And Joseph made haste, for his bowels burned for his brother; and he sought <I>a place</I> to weep, and he went into the chamber, and wept there.
<DT><A NAME="43:31">43:31</A><DD>And he washed his face, and came out, and controlled himself, and said, Set on bread.
<DT><A NAME="43:32">43:32</A><DD>And they set on for him by himself, and for them by themselves, and for the Egyptians who ate with him by themselves; because the Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews, for that is an abomination unto the Egyptians.
<DT><A NAME="43:33">43:33</A><DD>And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright, and the youngest according to his youth; and the men marvelled one at another.

<DT><A NAME="44:2">44:2</A><DD>And put my cup, the silver cup, in the mouth of the sack of the youngest, and his grain-money. And he did according to the word of Joseph which he had spoken.
<DT><A NAME="44:3">44:3</A><DD>In the morning, when it was light, the men were sent away, they and their asses.
<DT><A NAME="44:4">44:4</A><DD>They were gone out of the city, <I>and</I> not <I>yet</I> far off, when Joseph said to him who was over his house, Up! follow after the men; and when thou overtakest them, thou shalt say to them, Why have ye rewarded evil for good?
<DT><A NAME="44:5">44:5</A><DD>Is not this <I>it</I> in which my lord drinks, and in which indeed he <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ge?n=44:5">divines</A>? Ye have done evil <I>in</I> what ye have done.

<DT><A NAME="44:8">44:8</A><DD>Behold, the money that we found in our sacks' mouths we have brought again to thee from the land of Canaan; and how should we steal out of thy lord's house silver or gold?

<DT><A NAME="44:10">44:10</A><DD>And he said, Now also <I>let</I> it <I>be</I> according to your words: let him with whom it is found be my bondman, but ye shall be blameless.
<DT><A NAME="44:11">44:11</A><DD>And they hasted and laid down every man his sack on the ground, and opened every man his sack.
<DT><A NAME="44:12">44:12</A><DD>And he searched carefully: he began at the eldest, and ended at the youngest; and the cup was found in Benjamin's sack.
<DT><A NAME="44:13">44:13</A><DD>Then they rent their clothes, and loaded every man his ass, and they returned to the city.
<DT><A NAME="44:14">44:14</A><DD>And Judah and his brethren came to Joseph's house; and he was still there; and they fell down before him to the ground.
<DT><A NAME="44:15">44:15</A><DD>And Joseph said to them, What deed is this which ye have done? Did ye not know that such a man as I can certainly divine?
<DT><A NAME="44:16">44:16</A><DD>And Judah said, What shall we say to my lord? what shall we speak, and how justify ourselves? God has found out the iniquity of thy servants; behold, we are my lord's bondmen, both we, and he in whose hand the cup has been found.
<DT><A NAME="44:17">44:17</A><DD>And he said, Far be it from me to do so! The man in whose hand the cup has been found, he shall be my bondman; but as for you, go up in peace to your father.
<DT><A NAME="44:18">44:18</A><DD>Then Judah came near to him, and said, Ah! my lord, let thy servant, I pray thee, speak a word in my lord's ears, and let not thine anger burn against thy servant; for thou art even as Pharaoh.
<DT><A NAME="44:19">44:19</A><DD>My lord asked his servants, saying, Have ye a father, or a brother?

<DT><A NAME="50:5">50:5</A><DD>My father made me swear, saying, Behold, I die; in my grave which I have dug myself in the land of Canaan, there shalt thou bury me. And now, let me go up, I pray thee, that I may bury my father; and I will come again.
<DT><A NAME="50:6">50:6</A><DD>And Pharaoh said, Go up and bury thy father, according as he made thee swear.
<DT><A NAME="50:7">50:7</A><DD>And Joseph went up to bury his father; and with him went up all the bondmen of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, and all the elders of the land of Egypt,
<DT><A NAME="50:8">50:8</A><DD>and all the house of Joseph, and his brethren, and his father's house; only their little ones, and their flocks, and their herds, they left in the land of Goshen.
<DT><A NAME="50:9">50:9</A><DD>And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen; and the camp was very great.
<DT><A NAME="50:10">50:10</A><DD>And they came to the threshing-floor of Atad, which is beyond the Jordan; and there they lamented with a great and very grievous lamentation; and he made a mourning for his father of seven days.
<DT><A NAME="50:11">50:11</A><DD>And the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning at the threshing-floor of Atad, and they said, This is a grievous mourning of the Egyptians. Therefore the name of it was called <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ge?n=50:11">Abel-Mizraim</A>, which is beyond the Jordan.
<DT><A NAME="50:12">50:12</A><DD>And his sons did to him according as he had commanded them;

<DT><A NAME="50:14">50:14</A><DD>And, after he had buried his father, Joseph returned to Egypt, he and his brethren, and all that had gone up with him to bury his father.
<DT><A NAME="50:15">50:15</A><DD>And when Joseph's brethren saw that their father was dead, they said, If now Joseph should be hostile to us, and should indeed requite us all the evil that we did to him!
<DT><A NAME="50:16">50:16</A><DD>And they sent a messenger to Joseph, saying, Thy father commanded before he died, saying,
<DT><A NAME="50:17">50:17</A><DD>Thus shall ye speak to Joseph: Oh forgive, I pray thee, the transgression of thy brethren, and their sin! for they did evil to thee. And now, we pray thee, forgive the transgression of the servants of the God of thy father. And Joseph wept when they spoke to him.
<DT><A NAME="50:18">50:18</A><DD>And his brethren also went and fell down before his face, and said, Behold, we are thy bondmen.
<DT><A NAME="50:19">50:19</A><DD>And Joseph said to them, Fear not: am I then in the place of God?
<DT><A NAME="50:20">50:20</A><DD>Ye indeed meant evil against me: God meant it for good, in order that he might do as <I>it is</I> this day, to save a great people alive.
<DT><A NAME="50:21">50:21</A><DD>And now, fear not: I will maintain you and your little ones. And he comforted them, and spoke consolingly to them.
<DT><A NAME="50:22">50:22</A><DD>And Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he and his father's house; and Joseph lived a hundred and ten years.
<DT><A NAME="50:23">50:23</A><DD>And Joseph saw Ephraim's children of the third <I>generation</I>; the sons also of Machir the son of Manasseh were born on Joseph's knees.
<DT><A NAME="50:24">50:24</A><DD>And Joseph said to his brethren, I die; and God will certainly visit you, and bring you up out of this land, into the land that he swore unto Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.
<DT><A NAME="50:25">50:25</A><DD>And Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel, saying, God will certainly visit you; and ye shall carry up my bones hence.
<DT><A NAME="50:26">50:26</A><DD>And Joseph died, a hundred and ten years old; and they embalmed him; and he was put in a <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ge?n=50:26">coffin</A> in Egypt.
