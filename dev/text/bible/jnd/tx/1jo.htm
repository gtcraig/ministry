<DT><A NAME="1:1">1:1</A><DD>That which was from <I>the</I> beginning, that which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes; that which we contemplated, and our hands handled, concerning the word of life;
<DT><A NAME="1:2">1:2</A><DD>(and the life has been manifested, and we have seen, and bear witness, and <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1jo?n=1:2">report</A> to you the eternal life, <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1jo?n=1:2a">which</A> was with the Father, and has been manifested to us:)

<DT><A NAME="1:4">1:4</A><DD>And these things write we to you that your joy may be full.
<DT><A NAME="1:5">1:5</A><DD>And this is the message which we have heard from him, and declare to you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.
<DT><A NAME="1:6">1:6</A><DD>If we <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1jo?n=1:6">say</A> that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not practise the truth.

<DT><A NAME="2:2">2:2</A><DD>and *he* is the propitiation for our sins; but not for ours alone, but also for the whole world.
<DT><A NAME="2:3">2:3</A><DD>And hereby we know that we <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1jo?n=2:3">know</A> him, if we keep his commandments.
<DT><A NAME="2:4">2:4</A><DD>He that says, I know him, and does not keep his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him;
<DT><A NAME="2:5">2:5</A><DD>but whoever <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1jo?n=2:5">keeps</A> his word, in him verily the love of God is perfected. Hereby we know that we are in him.
<DT><A NAME="2:6">2:6</A><DD>He that says he abides in him ought, even as *he* walked, himself also <I>so</I> to walk.
<DT><A NAME="2:7">2:7</A><DD>Beloved, I write no new commandment to you, but an old commandment, which ye have <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1jo?n=2:7">had</A> from the beginning. The old commandment is the word which ye heard.
<DT><A NAME="2:8">2:8</A><DD>Again, I write a new commandment to you, which thing is true in him and in you, because the darkness is passing and the true light already shines.
<DT><A NAME="2:9">2:9</A><DD>He who says he is in the light, and hates his brother, is in <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1jo?n=2:9">the</A> darkness until now.
<DT><A NAME="2:10">2:10</A><DD>He that loves his brother abides in light, and there is no occasion of stumbling in him.
<DT><A NAME="2:11">2:11</A><DD>But he that hates his brother is in the darkness, and walks in the darkness, and knows not where he goes, because the darkness has blinded his eyes.
<DT><A NAME="2:12">2:12</A><DD>I write to you, children, because <I>your</I> sins are forgiven you for his name's sake.
<DT><A NAME="2:13">2:13</A><DD>I write to you, fathers, because ye have <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1jo?n=2:3">known</A> him <I>that is</I> from the beginning. I write to you, young men, because ye have <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1jo?n=2:13">overcome</A> the wicked <I>one</I>. I write to you, little <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1jo?n=2:13a">children</A>, because ye have <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1jo?n=2:3">known</A> the Father.
<DT><A NAME="2:14">2:14</A><DD>I have written to you, fathers, because ye have <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1jo?n=2:3">known</A> him <I>that is</I> from the beginning. I have written to you, young men, because ye are strong, and the word of God abides in you, and ye have <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1jo?n=2:13">overcome</A> the wicked <I>one</I>.
<DT><A NAME="2:15">2:15</A><DD>Love not the world, nor the things in the world. If any one love the world, the love of the Father is not in him;
<DT><A NAME="2:16">2:16</A><DD>because all that <I>is</I> in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world.
<DT><A NAME="2:17">2:17</A><DD>And the world is passing, and its lust, but he that <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1jo?n=2:17">does</A> the will of God abides for eternity.
<DT><A NAME="2:18">2:18</A><DD>Little <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1jo?n=2:18">children</A>, it is <I>the</I> last <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1jo?n=2:18a">hour</A>, and, according as ye have heard that antichrist comes, even now there have <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1jo?n=2:18b">come</A> many antichrists, whence we know that it is <I>the</I> last hour.
<DT><A NAME="2:19">2:19</A><DD>They went out from among us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would have surely remained with us, but that they might be made manifest that none are of us.
<DT><A NAME="2:20">2:20</A><DD>And *ye* have <I>the</I> unction from the holy <I>one</I>, and ye know all things.
<DT><A NAME="2:21">2:21</A><DD>I have not written to you because ye do not know the truth, but because ye know it, and that no lie is of the truth.
<DT><A NAME="2:22">2:22</A><DD>Who is the liar but he who denies that Jesus is the Christ? *He* is the antichrist who denies the Father and the Son.
<DT><A NAME="2:23">2:23</A><DD>Whoever denies the Son has not the Father either; he who confesses the Son has the Father also.
<DT><A NAME="2:24">2:24</A><DD>As for *you* let that which ye have heard from the beginning abide in you: if what ye have heard from the beginning abides in you, *ye* also shall abide in the Son and in the Father.
<DT><A NAME="2:25">2:25</A><DD>And this is the promise which *he* has promised us, life eternal.
<DT><A NAME="2:26">2:26</A><DD>These things have I written to you concerning those who lead you astray:

<DT><A NAME="2:28">2:28</A><DD>And now, children, abide in him, that <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1jo?n=2:28">if</A> he be manifested we may have boldness, and not be put to shame from before him at his coming.
<DT><A NAME="2:29">2:29</A><DD>If ye <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1jo?n=2:29">know</A> that he is righteous, <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1jo?n=2:29a">know</A> that every one who practises righteousness is begotten of him.

<DT><A NAME="3:2">3:2</A><DD>Beloved, now are we children of God, and what we shall be has not yet been <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1jo?n=3:2">manifested</A>; we <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1jo?n=3:2a">know</A> that if <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1jo?n=3:2b">it</A> is manifested we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is.
