<H2>Chapter 1</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="1:1">1:1</A><DD>Paul and Timotheus, bondmen of Jesus Christ, to all the saints in Christ Jesus who are in Philippi, with <I>the</I> overseers and <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_php?n=1:1">ministers</A>;
<DT><A NAME="1:2">1:2</A><DD>grace to you, and peace from God our Father and <I>the</I> Lord Jesus Christ.
<DT><A NAME="1:3">1:3</A><DD>I thank my God for my whole remembrance of you,
<DT><A NAME="1:4">1:4</A><DD>constantly in my every supplication, making the supplication for you all with joy,
<DT><A NAME="1:5">1:5</A><DD>because of your <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_php?n=1:5">fellowship</A> with the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_php?n=1:5a">gospel</A>, from the first day until now;
<DT><A NAME="1:6">1:6</A><DD>having confidence of this very thing, that he who has begun in you a good work will complete it unto Jesus Christ's day:
<DT><A NAME="1:7">1:7</A><DD>as it is <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_php?n=1:7">righteous</A> for me to think this as to you all, because ye have *me* in your hearts, and that both in my bonds and in the defence and confirmation of the glad tidings ye are all participators in my <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_php?n=1:7a">grace</A>.
<DT><A NAME="1:8">1:8</A><DD>For God is my witness how I long after you all in <I>the</I> bowels of Christ Jesus.
<DT><A NAME="1:9">1:9</A><DD>And this I pray, that your love may <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_php?n=1:9">abound</A> yet more and more in full knowledge and all intelligence,
<DT><A NAME="1:10">1:10</A><DD>that ye may judge of and approve the things that are more excellent, in order that ye may be pure and without offence for Christ's day,
<DT><A NAME="1:11">1:11</A><DD>being complete as regards the fruit of righteousness, which <I>is</I> by Jesus Christ, to God's glory and praise.
<DT><A NAME="1:12">1:12</A><DD>But I would have you know, brethren, that the circumstances in which I am have turned out rather to the furtherance of the glad tidings,
<DT><A NAME="1:13">1:13</A><DD>so that my bonds have become manifest <I>as being</I> in <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_php?n=1:13">Christ</A> in all the praetorium and to all <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_php?n=1:13a">others</A>;
<DT><A NAME="1:14">1:14</A><DD>and that the most of the brethren, trusting in <I>the</I> Lord through my bonds, dare more abundantly to speak the word of God fearlessly.
<DT><A NAME="1:15">1:15</A><DD>Some indeed also for envy and strife, but some also for good will, preach the Christ.
<DT><A NAME="1:16">1:16</A><DD>These indeed out of love, knowing that I am set for the defence of the glad tidings;
<DT><A NAME="1:17">1:17</A><DD>but those out of contention, announce the Christ, not purely, supposing to arouse tribulation for my bonds.
<DT><A NAME="1:18">1:18</A><DD>What is it then? at any rate, in every way, whether in pretext or in truth, Christ is announced; and in this I rejoice, yea, also I will rejoice;
<DT><A NAME="1:19">1:19</A><DD>for I know that this shall turn out for me to salvation, through your supplication and <I>the</I> supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ;
<DT><A NAME="1:20">1:20</A><DD>according to my <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_php?n=1:20">earnest</A> expectation and hope, that in nothing I shall be ashamed, but in all boldness, as always, now also Christ shall be magnified in my body whether by life or by death.
<DT><A NAME="1:21">1:21</A><DD>For for me to live <I>is</I> Christ, and to die gain;
<DT><A NAME="1:22">1:22</A><DD>but if to live in flesh <I>is my lot</I>, this is for me worth the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_php?n=1:22">while</A>: and what I shall choose I cannot tell.
<DT><A NAME="1:23">1:23</A><DD>But I am pressed by both, having the desire for departure and being with Christ, <I>for</I> <I>it is</I> very much better,
<DT><A NAME="1:24">1:24</A><DD>but remaining in the flesh <I>is</I> more necessary for your sakes;
<DT><A NAME="1:25">1:25</A><DD>and having confidence of this, I know that I shall remain and abide along with you all, for your progress and joy <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_php?n=1:25">in</A> faith;
<DT><A NAME="1:26">1:26</A><DD>that your boasting may abound in Christ Jesus through <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_php?n=1:26">me</A> by my presence again with you.
<DT><A NAME="1:27">1:27</A><DD>Only conduct yourselves worthily of the glad tidings of the Christ, in order that whether coming and seeing you, or absent, I may hear of what concerns you, that ye stand firm in one spirit, with one soul, labouring together <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_php?n=1:27">in</A> the same conflict with the faith of the glad tidings;
<DT><A NAME="1:28">1:28</A><DD>and not frightened in anything by the opposers, which is to them a demonstration of destruction, but of your salvation, and that from God;
<DT><A NAME="1:29">1:29</A><DD>because to you has been given, as regards <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_php?n=1:29">Christ</A>, not only the believing on him but the suffering for him also,
<DT><A NAME="1:30">1:30</A><DD>having the same conflict which ye have seen in me, and now hear of in me.
</DL></DIV><H2>Chapter 2</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="2:1">2:1</A><DD>If then <I>there be</I> any <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_php?n=2:1">comfort</A> in Christ, if any consolation of love, if any fellowship of <I>the</I> Spirit, if any bowels and compassions,
<DT><A NAME="2:2">2:2</A><DD>fulfil my joy, <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_php?n=2:2">that</A> ye may think the same thing, having the same love, joined in soul, thinking one thing;
<DT><A NAME="2:3">2:3</A><DD><I>let</I> <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_php?n=2:3">nothing</A> <I>be</I> in the spirit of strife or vain glory, but, in lowliness of mind, each esteeming the other as more excellent than themselves;
<DT><A NAME="2:4">2:4</A><DD>regarding not each his own <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_php?n=2:4"><I>qualities</I></A>, but each those of others also.
<DT><A NAME="2:5">2:5</A><DD>For let this mind be in <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_php?n=2:5">you</A> which <I>was</I> also in Christ Jesus;
<DT><A NAME="2:6">2:6</A><DD>who, subsisting in the form of God, did not esteem it an object of <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_php?n=2:6">rapine</A> to be on an equality with God;
<DT><A NAME="2:7">2:7</A><DD>but emptied <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_php?n=2:7">himself</A>, taking a bondman's form, taking his <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_php?n=2:7a">place</A> in <I>the</I> likeness of men;
<DT><A NAME="2:8">2:8</A><DD>and having been found in figure as a man, humbled himself, becoming obedient even unto death, and <I>that the</I> death of <I>the</I> cross.
<DT><A NAME="2:9">2:9</A><DD>Wherefore also God <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_php?n=2:9">highly</A> exalted him, and granted him a name, that which is above every name,
<DT><A NAME="2:10">2:10</A><DD>that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of heavenly and earthly and infernal <I>beings</I>,
<DT><A NAME="2:11">2:11</A><DD>and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ <I>is</I> Lord to God <I>the</I> Father's glory.
<DT><A NAME="2:12">2:12</A><DD>So that, my beloved, even as ye have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much rather in my absence, work <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_php?n=2:12">out</A> your own salvation with fear and trembling,
<DT><A NAME="2:13">2:13</A><DD>for it is God who <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_php?n=2:13">works</A> in you both the willing and the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_php?n=2:13">working</A> according to <I>his</I> good pleasure.
<DT><A NAME="2:14">2:14</A><DD>Do all things without murmurings and reasonings,
<DT><A NAME="2:15">2:15</A><DD>that ye may be harmless and simple, irreproachable children of God in the midst of a crooked and perverted <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_php?n=2:15">generation</A>; among whom ye <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_php?n=2:15a">appear</A> as lights in <I>the</I> world,
<DT><A NAME="2:16">2:16</A><DD>holding forth <I>the</I> word of life, so as to be a boast for me in Christ's day, that I have not run in vain nor laboured in <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_php?n=2:16">vain</A>.
<DT><A NAME="2:17">2:17</A><DD>But if also I am poured out as a libation on the sacrifice and ministration of your faith, I rejoice, and rejoice in common with you all.
<DT><A NAME="2:18">2:18</A><DD>In like manner do *ye* also rejoice, and rejoice with me.
<DT><A NAME="2:19">2:19</A><DD>But I hope in <I>the</I> Lord Jesus to send Timotheus to you shortly, that *I* also may be refreshed, knowing how ye get on.
<DT><A NAME="2:20">2:20</A><DD>For I have no one like-minded who will care with genuine feeling how ye get on.
<DT><A NAME="2:21">2:21</A><DD>For all seek their own things, not the things of Jesus Christ.
<DT><A NAME="2:22">2:22</A><DD>But ye know the proof of him, that, as a child a father, he has served with me in the work of the glad tidings.
<DT><A NAME="2:23">2:23</A><DD>Him therefore I hope to send immediately, as soon as I shall see how it goes with me:
<DT><A NAME="2:24">2:24</A><DD>but I trust in <I>the</I> Lord that I myself also shall soon come;
<DT><A NAME="2:25">2:25</A><DD>but I have thought it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother and fellow-workman and fellow-soldier, but your messenger and <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_php?n=2:25">minister</A> to my need,
<DT><A NAME="2:26">2:26</A><DD>since he had a longing desire after you all, and was distressed because ye had heard that he was sick;
<DT><A NAME="2:27">2:27</A><DD>for he was also sick close to <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_php?n=2:27">death</A>, but God had mercy on him, and not indeed on him alone, but also on me, that I might not have sorrow upon sorrow.
<DT><A NAME="2:28">2:28</A><DD>I have sent him therefore the more diligently, that seeing him ye might again <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_php?n=2:28">rejoice</A>, and that *I* might be the less sorrowful.
<DT><A NAME="2:29">2:29</A><DD>Receive him therefore in <I>the</I> Lord with all joy, and hold such in honour;
<DT><A NAME="2:30">2:30</A><DD>because for the sake of the work he drew near even to death, venturing his life that he might fill up what lacked in your ministration toward me.
</DL></DIV><H2>Chapter 3</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="3:1">3:1</A><DD>For the rest, my brethren, rejoice in <I>the</I> Lord: to write the same things to you, to me <I>is</I> not irksome, and for you safe.
<DT><A NAME="3:2">3:2</A><DD>See to dogs, see to evil workmen, see to the concision.
<DT><A NAME="3:3">3:3</A><DD>For *we* are the circumcision, who worship by <I>the</I> Spirit of <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_php?n=3:3">God</A>, and boast in Christ Jesus, and do not trust in flesh.
<DT><A NAME="3:4">3:4</A><DD>Though *I* have <I>my</I> trust even in flesh; if any other think to trust in flesh, *I* rather:
<DT><A NAME="3:5">3:5</A><DD>as to circumcision, <I>I received it</I> the eighth day; of <I>the</I> race of Israel, of <I>the</I> tribe of Benjamin, Hebrew of Hebrews; as to <I>the</I> law, a Pharisee;
<DT><A NAME="3:6">3:6</A><DD>as to zeal, persecuting the assembly; as to righteousness which <I>is</I> in <I>the</I> law, <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_php?n=3:6">found</A> blameless;
<DT><A NAME="3:7">3:7</A><DD>but what things were gain to me these I counted, on account of Christ, loss.
<DT><A NAME="3:8">3:8</A><DD>But surely I count also all things to be loss on account of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, on account of whom I have suffered the loss of all, and count them to be filth, that I may gain <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_php?n=3:8">Christ</A>;
<DT><A NAME="3:9">3:9</A><DD>and that I may be found in him, not having my righteousness, which <I>would <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_php?n=3:9">be</A></I> on the principle of law, but that which is by faith of Christ, the righteousness which <I>is</I> of God <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_php?n=3:9a">through</A> faith,
<DT><A NAME="3:10">3:10</A><DD>to know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being conformed to his death,
<DT><A NAME="3:11">3:11</A><DD>if any way I arrive at the resurrection from among <I>the</I> dead.
<DT><A NAME="3:12">3:12</A><DD>Not that I have already obtained <I>the prize</I>, or am already perfected; but I pursue, if also I may get possession <I>of it</I>, seeing that <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_php?n=3:12">also</A> I have been taken possession of by Christ <I>Jesus</I>.
<DT><A NAME="3:13">3:13</A><DD>Brethren, *I* do not count to have got possession myself; but one thing -- forgetting the things behind, and stretching out to the things before,
<DT><A NAME="3:14">3:14</A><DD>I pursue, <I>looking</I> towards <I>the</I> goal, for the prize of the calling on high of God in Christ Jesus.
<DT><A NAME="3:15">3:15</A><DD>As many therefore as <I>are</I> <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_php?n=3:15">perfect</A>, let us be thus minded; and if ye are any otherwise minded, this also God shall reveal to you.
<DT><A NAME="3:16">3:16</A><DD>But whereto we have attained, <I>let us</I> walk in the same steps.
<DT><A NAME="3:17">3:17</A><DD>Be imitators <I>all</I> together of me, brethren, and fix your eyes on those walking thus as you have us for a model;
<DT><A NAME="3:18">3:18</A><DD>(for many walk of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even weeping, that they <I>are</I> the enemies of the cross of Christ:
<DT><A NAME="3:19">3:19</A><DD>whose end <I>is</I> destruction, whose god <I>is</I> the belly, and <I>their</I> glory in their shame, who mind earthly things:)
<DT><A NAME="3:20">3:20</A><DD>for *our* <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_php?n=3:20">commonwealth</A> has its existence in <I>the</I> heavens, from which also we await the Lord Jesus Christ <I>as</I> Saviour,
<DT><A NAME="3:21">3:21</A><DD>who shall transform our body of humiliation into conformity to his body of glory, according to the working of <I>the</I> power which he has even to subdue all things to himself.
</DL></DIV><H2>Chapter 4</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="4:1">4:1</A><DD>So that, my brethren, beloved and longed for, my joy and crown, thus stand fast in <I>the</I> Lord, beloved.
<DT><A NAME="4:2">4:2</A><DD>I exhort Euodia, and exhort Syntyche, to be of the same mind in <I>the</I> Lord;
<DT><A NAME="4:3">4:3</A><DD>yea, I ask thee also, true yokefellow, assist <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_php?n=4:3">them</A>, <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_php?n=4:3a">who</A> have contended along with me in the glad tidings, with Clement also, and my other fellow-labourers, whose names <I>are</I> in <I>the</I> book of life.
<DT><A NAME="4:4">4:4</A><DD>Rejoice in <I>the</I> Lord always: again I will say, Rejoice.
<DT><A NAME="4:5">4:5</A><DD>Let your <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_php?n=4:5">gentleness</A> be known of all men. The Lord <I>is</I> near.
<DT><A NAME="4:6">4:6</A><DD>Be careful about nothing; but in everything, by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_php?n=4:6">to</A> God;
<DT><A NAME="4:7">4:7</A><DD>and the peace of God, which surpasses every understanding, shall guard your hearts and your thoughts by Christ Jesus.
<DT><A NAME="4:8">4:8</A><DD>For the rest, brethren, whatsoever things <I>are</I> true, whatsoever things <I>are</I> <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_php?n=4:8">noble</A>, whatsoever things <I>are</I> just, whatsoever things <I>are</I> pure, whatsoever things <I>are</I> <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_php?n=4:8a">amiable</A>, whatsoever things <I>are</I> of good report; if <I>there be</I> any virtue and if any praise, think on these things.
<DT><A NAME="4:9">4:9</A><DD>What ye have both learned, and received, and heard, and seen in me, these things do; and the God of peace shall be with you.
<DT><A NAME="4:10">4:10</A><DD>But I rejoiced in <I>the</I> Lord greatly, that now however at length ye have revived your thinking of me, though <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_php?n=4:10">surely</A> ye did also think <I>of me</I>, but lacked opportunity.
<DT><A NAME="4:11">4:11</A><DD>Not that I speak as regards privation, for as to me *I* have learnt in those circumstances in which I am, to be satisfied in myself.
<DT><A NAME="4:12">4:12</A><DD>I know both how to be abased and I know how to abound. In everything and in all things I am initiated both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer privation.
<DT><A NAME="4:13">4:13</A><DD>I have strength for all things in him that gives me power.
<DT><A NAME="4:14">4:14</A><DD>But ye have done well in taking part in my affliction.
<DT><A NAME="4:15">4:15</A><DD>And know also *ye*, O Philippians, that in <I>the</I> beginning of the gospel, when I <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_php?n=4:15">came</A> out of Macedonia, no assembly communicated <I>anything</I> to me in <I>the</I> way of giving and receiving save *ye* alone;
<DT><A NAME="4:16">4:16</A><DD>for also in Thessalonica once and even twice ye sent to me for my <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_php?n=4:16">need</A>.
<DT><A NAME="4:17">4:17</A><DD>Not that I seek gift, but I seek fruit abounding to your account.
<DT><A NAME="4:18">4:18</A><DD>But I have all things in full supply and abound; I am full, having received of Epaphroditus the things <I>sent</I> from you, an odour of sweet savour, an acceptable sacrifice, agreeable to God.
<DT><A NAME="4:19">4:19</A><DD>But my God shall abundantly supply all your need according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus.
<DT><A NAME="4:20">4:20</A><DD>But to our God and Father <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_php?n=4:20"><I>be</I></A> glory to the ages of ages. Amen.
<DT><A NAME="4:21">4:21</A><DD>Salute every saint in Christ Jesus. The brethren who <I>are</I> with me salute you.
<DT><A NAME="4:22">4:22</A><DD>All the saints salute you, and specially those of the household of Caesar.
<DT><A NAME="4:23">4:23</A><DD>The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ <I>be</I> with your spirit. Amen.
