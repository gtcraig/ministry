<H2>Chapter 1</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="1:1">1:1</A><DD>And it came to pass after the death of Saul, when David had returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, that David abode two days in Ziklag.
<DT><A NAME="1:2">1:2</A><DD>And it came to pass on the third day, that behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul with his garments rent, and earth upon his head; and as soon as he came to David, he fell to the earth and did obeisance.
<DT><A NAME="1:3">1:3</A><DD>And David said to him, Whence comest thou? And he said to him, Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped.
<DT><A NAME="1:4">1:4</A><DD>And David said to him, What has taken place? I pray thee, tell me. And he said that the people had fled from the battle, and many of the people also had fallen and died, and that Saul and Jonathan his son were dead also.
<DT><A NAME="1:5">1:5</A><DD>And David said to the young man that told him, How knowest thou that Saul and Jonathan his son are dead?
<DT><A NAME="1:6">1:6</A><DD>And the young man that told him said, I happened by chance to be upon mount Gilboa, and behold, Saul leaned on his spear; and behold, the chariots and horsemen followed hard after him.
<DT><A NAME="1:7">1:7</A><DD>And he looked behind him, and saw me, and called to me. And I said, Here am I.
<DT><A NAME="1:8">1:8</A><DD>And he said to me, Who art thou? And I said to him, I am an Amalekite.
<DT><A NAME="1:9">1:9</A><DD>He said to me again, Stand, I pray thee, over me, and slay me; for <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2sa?n=1:9">anguish</A> has seized me; for my life is yet whole in me.
<DT><A NAME="1:10">1:10</A><DD>So I stood over him, and put him to death, for I knew that he would not live after his fall; and I took the crown that was upon his head, and the bracelet that was on his arm, and have brought them hither to my lord.
<DT><A NAME="1:11">1:11</A><DD>Then David took hold of his garments and rent them; and all the men that were with him <I>did</I> likewise.
<DT><A NAME="1:12">1:12</A><DD>And they mourned, and wept, and fasted until even for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of Jehovah, and for the house of Israel; because they were fallen by the sword.
<DT><A NAME="1:13">1:13</A><DD>And David said to the young man that told him, Whence art thou? And he said, I am the son of an Amalekite stranger.
<DT><A NAME="1:14">1:14</A><DD>And David said to him, How wast thou not afraid to stretch forth thy hand to destroy Jehovah's anointed?
<DT><A NAME="1:15">1:15</A><DD>Then David called one of the young men and said, Draw near, <I>and</I> fall on him. And he smote him that he died.
<DT><A NAME="1:16">1:16</A><DD>And David said to him, Thy blood be upon thy head; for thy mouth has testified against thee, saying, I have slain Jehovah's anointed.
<DT><A NAME="1:17">1:17</A><DD>And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son;
<DT><A NAME="1:18">1:18</A><DD>and he bade them teach the children of Judah <I>the song of</I> <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2sa?n=1:18">the</A> bow. Behold, it is written in the book of <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2sa?n=1:18a">Jasher</A>: --
<DT><A NAME="1:19">1:19</A><DD>The beauty of Israel is slain upon thy high places: how are the mighty fallen!
<DT><A NAME="1:20">1:20</A><DD>Tell <I>it</I> not in Gath, carry not the tidings in the streets of Ashkelon; Lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, Lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.
<DT><A NAME="1:21">1:21</A><DD>Ye mountains <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2sa?n=1:21">of</A> Gilboa, let there be no dew, no rain upon you, nor fields of <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2sa?n=1:21a">heave-offerings</A>! For there the shield of the mighty was vilely cast away, The shield of Saul, <I>as</I> not anointed with oil.
<DT><A NAME="1:22">1:22</A><DD>From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, The bow of Jonathan turned not back, And the sword of Saul returned not empty.
<DT><A NAME="1:23">1:23</A><DD>Saul and Jonathan, beloved and pleasant in their lives, Even in their death were not divided; They were swifter than eagles, they were stronger than lions.
<DT><A NAME="1:24">1:24</A><DD>Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in scarlet with <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2sa?n=1:24">splendour</A>, Who put ornaments of gold upon your apparel.
<DT><A NAME="1:25">1:25</A><DD>How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! Jonathan is slain upon thy high places.
<DT><A NAME="1:26">1:26</A><DD>I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan: very pleasant wast thou unto me; Thy love to me was wonderful, passing women's love.
<DT><A NAME="1:27">1:27</A><DD>How are the mighty fallen, and the instruments of war perished!
</DL></DIV><H2>Chapter 2</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="2:1">2:1</A><DD>And it came to pass after this that David inquired of Jehovah, saying, Shall I go up into one of the cities of Judah? And Jehovah said to him, Go up. And David said, Whither shall I go up? And he said, Unto Hebron.
<DT><A NAME="2:2">2:2</A><DD>So David went up thither, and his two wives also, Ahinoam the Jizreelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite.
<DT><A NAME="2:3">2:3</A><DD>And his men that were with him did David bring up, every man with his household; and they dwelt in the cities of Hebron.
<DT><A NAME="2:4">2:4</A><DD>And the men of Judah came, and there they anointed David king over the house of Judah. And they told David, saying, It is the men of Jabesh-Gilead that have buried Saul.
<DT><A NAME="2:5">2:5</A><DD>And David sent messengers to the men of Jabesh-Gilead, and said to them, Blessed be ye of Jehovah, that ye have shewn this kindness to your lord, to Saul, and have buried him!
<DT><A NAME="2:6">2:6</A><DD>And now Jehovah shew kindness and faithfulness to you; and I also will requite you this good, because ye have done this thing.
<DT><A NAME="2:7">2:7</A><DD>And now let your hands be strong, and be ye valiant; for your master Saul is dead, and also the house of Judah have anointed me king over them.
<DT><A NAME="2:8">2:8</A><DD>And Abner the son of Ner, captain of Saul's host, took <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2sa?n=2:8">Ishbosheth</A> the son of Saul, and brought him over to Mahanaim;
<DT><A NAME="2:9">2:9</A><DD>and made him king over Gilead, and over the Asshurites, and over Jizreel, and over Ephraim, and over Benjamin, and over all Israel.
<DT><A NAME="2:10">2:10</A><DD>Ishbosheth Saul's son was forty years old when he began to reign over Israel, and he reigned two years. However, the house of Judah followed David.
<DT><A NAME="2:11">2:11</A><DD>And the time that David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months.
<DT><A NAME="2:12">2:12</A><DD>And Abner the son of Ner, and the servants of Ishbosheth the son of Saul, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon.
<DT><A NAME="2:13">2:13</A><DD>And Joab the son of Zeruiah, and the servants of David, went out. And they met together by the pool of Gibeon; and they sat down, these on the one side of the pool, and those on the other side of the pool.
<DT><A NAME="2:14">2:14</A><DD>And Abner said to Joab, Let the young men now arise and make sport before us. And Joab said, Let them arise.
<DT><A NAME="2:15">2:15</A><DD>And they arose and went over by number, twelve for Benjamin, and for Ishbosheth the son of Saul, and twelve of the servants of David.
<DT><A NAME="2:16">2:16</A><DD>And they caught every one his fellow by the head, and <I>thrust</I> his sword in his fellow's side, and they fell down together. And that place was called <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2sa?n=2:16">Helkath-hazzurim</A>, which is by Gibeon.
<DT><A NAME="2:17">2:17</A><DD>And the battle that day was very severe; and Abner and the men of Israel were routed before the servants of David.
<DT><A NAME="2:18">2:18</A><DD>And there were three sons of Zeruiah there, Joab, and Abishai, and Asahel. Now Asahel was swift of foot, as one of the gazelles that are in the field.
<DT><A NAME="2:19">2:19</A><DD>And Asahel pursued after Abner; and in going he turned not to the right hand nor to the left from behind Abner.
<DT><A NAME="2:20">2:20</A><DD>Then Abner looked behind him, and said, Art thou Asahel? And he said, I am.
<DT><A NAME="2:21">2:21</A><DD>And Abner said to him, Turn thee aside, to thy right hand or to thy left, and lay hold of one of the young men, and take for thyself his armour. But Asahel would not turn aside from following him.
<DT><A NAME="2:22">2:22</A><DD>And Abner said again to Asahel, Turn thee aside from following me: why should I smite thee to the ground? how then should I hold up my face to Joab thy brother?
<DT><A NAME="2:23">2:23</A><DD>But he refused to turn aside; therefore Abner with the hinder end of the spear smote him in the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2sa?n=2:23">belly</A>, so that the spear came out behind him; and he fell down there, and died in the same place. And it came to pass, that as many as came to the place where Asahel fell down and died stood still.
<DT><A NAME="2:24">2:24</A><DD>And Joab and Abishai pursued after Abner; and the sun went down when they came to the hill of Ammah, which is before Giah on the way to the wilderness of Gibeon.
<DT><A NAME="2:25">2:25</A><DD>And the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together after Abner, and became one troop, and stood on the top of a hill.
<DT><A NAME="2:26">2:26</A><DD>And Abner called to Joab, and said, Shall the sword devour for ever? knowest thou not that it will be bitterness in the latter end? and how long shall it be ere thou bid the people return from following their brethren?
<DT><A NAME="2:27">2:27</A><DD>And Joab said, <I>As</I> God liveth, unless thou hadst spoken, surely then in the morning the people had gone up every one from following his brother.
<DT><A NAME="2:28">2:28</A><DD>And Joab blew the trumpet, and all the people stood still, and pursued after Israel no more, neither did they fight any more.
<DT><A NAME="2:29">2:29</A><DD>And Abner and his men walked all that night through the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2sa?n=2:29">plain</A>, and passed over the Jordan, and went through all Bithron, and they came to Mahanaim.
<DT><A NAME="2:30">2:30</A><DD>And Joab returned from following Abner, and gathered all the people together; and there lacked of David's servants nineteen men, and Asahel.
<DT><A NAME="2:31">2:31</A><DD>And the servants of David had smitten of Benjamin, and of Abner's men, three hundred and sixty men, who had died.
<DT><A NAME="2:32">2:32</A><DD>And they took up Asahel, and buried him in the sepulchre of his father, which was in Bethlehem. And Joab and his men went all night, and they came to Hebron at break of day.
</DL></DIV><H2>Chapter 3</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="3:1">3:1</A><DD>And the war was long between the house of Saul and the house of David; but David became continually stronger, and the house of Saul became continually weaker.
<DT><A NAME="3:2">3:2</A><DD>And to David were sons born in Hebron: his firstborn was Amnon, of Ahinoam the Jizreelitess;
<DT><A NAME="3:3">3:3</A><DD>and his second, Chileab, of Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite; and the third, <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2sa?n=3:3">Absalom</A> the son of Maachah, daughter of Talmai king of Geshur;
<DT><A NAME="3:4">3:4</A><DD>and the fourth, Adonijah the son of Haggith; and the fifth, Shephatiah the son of Abital;
<DT><A NAME="3:5">3:5</A><DD>and the sixth, Ithream, of Eglah David's wife. These were born to David in Hebron.
<DT><A NAME="3:6">3:6</A><DD>And it came to pass while there was war between the house of Saul and the house of David, that Abner made himself strong for the house of Saul.
<DT><A NAME="3:7">3:7</A><DD>And Saul had a concubine whose name was Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah. And <I>Ishbosheth</I> said to Abner, Why hast thou gone in to my father's concubine?
<DT><A NAME="3:8">3:8</A><DD>Then was Abner very wroth for the words of Ishbosheth, and said, Am I a dog's head, I who against Judah do shew kindness this day to the house of Saul thy father, to his brethren, and to his friends, and have not delivered thee into the hand of David, that thou reproachest me this day with the fault of this woman?
<DT><A NAME="3:9">3:9</A><DD>So do God to Abner, and more also, if, as Jehovah has sworn to David, I do not so to him;
<DT><A NAME="3:10">3:10</A><DD>to translate the kingdom from the house of Saul, and to set up the throne of David over Israel and over Judah, from Dan even to Beer-sheba!
<DT><A NAME="3:11">3:11</A><DD>And he could not answer Abner a word again, because he feared him.
<DT><A NAME="3:12">3:12</A><DD>And Abner sent messengers to David on his behalf, saying, Whose is the land? saying <I>also</I>, Make thy covenant with me, and behold, my hand shall be with thee, to turn all Israel to thee.
<DT><A NAME="3:13">3:13</A><DD>And he said, Well, I will make a covenant with thee; only I require one thing of thee, that is, Thou shalt not see my face, except thou first bring Michal Saul's daughter, when thou comest to see my face.
<DT><A NAME="3:14">3:14</A><DD>And David sent messengers to Ishbosheth Saul's son, saying, Deliver me my wife Michal, whom I espoused to me for a hundred foreskins of the Philistines.
<DT><A NAME="3:15">3:15</A><DD>And Ishbosheth sent, and took her from <I>her</I> husband, from Phaltiel the son of Laish.
<DT><A NAME="3:16">3:16</A><DD>And her husband went with her along weeping behind her to Bahurim. Then said Abner to him, Go, return. And he returned.
<DT><A NAME="3:17">3:17</A><DD>Now Abner had communicated with the elders of Israel, saying, Ye sought for David aforetime to be king over you;
<DT><A NAME="3:18">3:18</A><DD>and now do <I>it</I>, for Jehovah has spoken of David, saying, By my servant David will I save my people Israel out of the hand of the Philistines, and out of the hand of all their enemies.
<DT><A NAME="3:19">3:19</A><DD>And Abner also spoke in the ears of Benjamin; and Abner went also to speak in the ears of David in Hebron all that seemed good to Israel, and that seemed good to the whole house of Benjamin.
<DT><A NAME="3:20">3:20</A><DD>So Abner came to David to Hebron, and twenty men with him. And David made Abner and the men that were with him a repast.
<DT><A NAME="3:21">3:21</A><DD>And Abner said to David, I will arise and go, and will gather all Israel to my lord the king, that they may make a covenant with thee, and that thou mayest reign over all that thy heart desires. And David sent Abner away; and he went in peace.
<DT><A NAME="3:22">3:22</A><DD>And behold, the servants of David and Joab came from an expedition, and brought in a great spoil with them; but Abner was no longer with David in Hebron, for he had sent him away, and he had gone in peace.
<DT><A NAME="3:23">3:23</A><DD>And Joab and all the host that was with him came; and they told Joab, saying, Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and he has sent him away; and he is gone in peace.
<DT><A NAME="3:24">3:24</A><DD>Then Joab came to the king, and said, What hast thou done? behold, Abner came to thee; why is it <I>that</I> thou hast sent him away, and he is gone?
<DT><A NAME="3:25">3:25</A><DD>Thou knowest Abner the son of Ner, that he came to deceive thee, to know thy going out and thy coming in, and to know all that thou doest.
<DT><A NAME="3:26">3:26</A><DD>And when Joab was come out from David, he sent messengers after Abner, who brought him again from the well of Sirah; but David did not know it.
<DT><A NAME="3:27">3:27</A><DD>And when Abner was returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside in the gate to speak with him secretly, and smote him there in the belly, that he died, for the blood of Asahel his brother.
<DT><A NAME="3:28">3:28</A><DD>And afterwards David heard <I>it</I>, and he said, I and my kingdom are guiltless before Jehovah for ever from the blood of Abner the son of Ner:
<DT><A NAME="3:29">3:29</A><DD>let it fall on the head of Joab, and on all his father's house; and let there not fail from the house of Joab one that has an issue, or that is a leper, or that leans on a staff, or that falls by the sword, or that lacks bread!
<DT><A NAME="3:30">3:30</A><DD>So Joab and Abishai his brother killed Abner, because he had slain their brother Asahel at Gibeon in the battle.
<DT><A NAME="3:31">3:31</A><DD>And David said to Joab, and to all the people that were with him, Rend your garments, and gird yourselves with sackcloth, and mourn before Abner. And king David followed the bier.
<DT><A NAME="3:32">3:32</A><DD>And they buried Abner in Hebron; and the king lifted up his voice and wept at the grave of Abner; and all the people wept.
<DT><A NAME="3:33">3:33</A><DD>And the king lamented over Abner, and said, Should Abner die as a <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2sa?n=3:33">fool</A> dieth?
<DT><A NAME="3:34">3:34</A><DD>Thy hands were not bound, Nor thy feet put into fetters; As a man falleth before wicked men, Fellest thou! And all the people wept again over him.
<DT><A NAME="3:35">3:35</A><DD>And all the people came to cause David to eat bread while it was yet day; but David swore, saying, So do God to me, and more also, if I taste bread or aught else till the sun be down!
<DT><A NAME="3:36">3:36</A><DD>And all the people remarked it, and it pleased them; as whatever the king did pleased all the people.
<DT><A NAME="3:37">3:37</A><DD>And all the people and all Israel understood that day that it was not of the king to put Abner the son of Ner to death.
<DT><A NAME="3:38">3:38</A><DD>And the king said to his servants, Know ye not that there is a prince and a great man fallen this day in Israel?
<DT><A NAME="3:39">3:39</A><DD>And I am this day weak, <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2sa?n=3:39">though</A> anointed king; and these men, the sons of Zeruiah, are too hard for <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2sa?n=3:39a">me</A>: Jehovah reward the doer of evil according to his wickedness!
</DL></DIV><H2>Chapter 4</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>

<DT><A NAME="5:2">5:2</A><DD>Even aforetime, when Saul was king over us, thou wast he that leddest out and broughtest in Israel; and Jehovah said to thee, Thou shalt feed my people Israel, and thou shalt be prince over Israel.
<DT><A NAME="5:3">5:3</A><DD>And all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron; and king David made a covenant with them in Hebron before Jehovah; and they anointed David king over Israel.
<DT><A NAME="5:4">5:4</A><DD>David was thirty years old when he began to reign; he reigned forty years.

<DT><A NAME="5:6">5:6</A><DD>And the king and his men went to Jerusalem against the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land; and they spoke to David, saying, Thou shalt not come in hither, but the blind and the lame will drive thee <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2sa?n=5:6">back</A>; as much as to say, David will not come in hither.
<DT><A NAME="5:7">5:7</A><DD>But David took the stronghold of Zion, which is the city of David.

<DT><A NAME="5:19">5:19</A><DD>And David inquired of Jehovah, saying, Shall I go up against the Philistines? wilt thou give them into my hand? And Jehovah said to David, Go up; for I will certainly give the Philistines into thy hand.
<DT><A NAME="5:20">5:20</A><DD>And David came to Baal-perazim, and David smote them there; and he said, Jehovah has broken in upon mine enemies before me, as the breaking forth of waters. Therefore he called the name of that place <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2sa?n=5:20">Baal-perazim</A>.
<DT><A NAME="5:21">5:21</A><DD>And they left their images there, and David and his men took them away.
<DT><A NAME="5:22">5:22</A><DD>And the Philistines came up yet again, and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.
<DT><A NAME="5:23">5:23</A><DD>And David inquired of Jehovah; and he said, Thou shalt not go up; turn round behind them and come upon them opposite the mulberry-trees.

<DT><A NAME="6:3">6:3</A><DD>And they set the ark of God upon a new cart, and brought it out of the house of Abinadab, which was upon the hill; and Uzzah and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, drove the new cart.
<DT><A NAME="6:4">6:4</A><DD>And they brought it with the ark of God out of the house of Abinadab which was upon the hill; and Ahio went before the ark.

<DT><A NAME="6:6">6:6</A><DD>And when they came to Nachon's threshing-floor, Uzzah reached after the ark of God, and took hold of it; for the oxen had <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2sa?n=6:6">stumbled</A>.
<DT><A NAME="6:7">6:7</A><DD>And the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Uzzah; and God smote him there for his error; and there he died by the ark of God.
<DT><A NAME="6:8">6:8</A><DD>And David was indignant, because Jehovah had made a breach upon Uzzah; and he called that place <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2sa?n=6:8">Perez-Uzzah</A> to this day.
<DT><A NAME="6:9">6:9</A><DD>And David was afraid of Jehovah that day, and said, How shall the ark of Jehovah come to me?
<DT><A NAME="6:10">6:10</A><DD>So David would not bring the ark of Jehovah home unto himself into the city of David; but David carried it aside into the house of Obed-Edom the Gittite.
<DT><A NAME="6:11">6:11</A><DD>And the ark of Jehovah remained in the house of Obed-Edom the Gittite three months; and Jehovah blessed Obed-Edom and all his household.
<DT><A NAME="6:12">6:12</A><DD>And it was told king David, saying, Jehovah has blessed the house of Obed-Edom, and all that is his, because of the ark of God. And David went and brought up the ark of God from the house of Obed-Edom into the city of David with joy.
<DT><A NAME="6:13">6:13</A><DD>And it was so, that when they that bore the ark of Jehovah had gone six paces, he sacrificed an ox and a fatted beast.
<DT><A NAME="6:14">6:14</A><DD>And David danced before Jehovah with all his might; and David was girded with a linen ephod.
<DT><A NAME="6:15">6:15</A><DD>And David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of Jehovah with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet.
<DT><A NAME="6:16">6:16</A><DD>And as the ark of Jehovah came into the city of David, Michal the daughter of Saul looked through a window, and saw king David leaping and dancing before Jehovah; and she despised him in her heart.
<DT><A NAME="6:17">6:17</A><DD>And they brought in the ark of Jehovah, and set it in its place, in the midst of the tent that David had spread for it. And David offered up burnt-offerings and peace-offerings before Jehovah.
<DT><A NAME="6:18">6:18</A><DD>And when David had ended offering up the burnt-offerings and the peace-offerings, he blessed the people in the name of Jehovah of hosts.
<DT><A NAME="6:19">6:19</A><DD>And he dealt to all the people, to the whole multitude of Israel, both men and women, to every one a cake of bread, and a measure <I>of <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2sa?n=6:19">wine</A>,</I> and a raisin-cake. And all the people departed every one to his house.
<DT><A NAME="6:20">6:20</A><DD>And David returned to bless his household. And Michal the daughter of Saul came out to meet David, and said, How honourable did the king of Israel make himself to-day, who uncovered himself to-day in the eyes of the handmaids of his servants, as one of the lewd fellows shamelessly uncovers himself!
<DT><A NAME="6:21">6:21</A><DD>And David said to Michal, It was before Jehovah, who chose me rather than thy father, and than all his house, to <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2sa?n=6:21">appoint</A> me <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2sa?n=6:21a">ruler</A> over the people of Jehovah, over Israel; and I played before Jehovah.

<DT><A NAME="10:4">10:4</A><DD>And Hanun took David's servants, and had the one half of their beards shaved off, and their raiment cut off in the midst, as far as their buttocks, and sent them away.

<DT><A NAME="12:1">12:1</A><DD>And Jehovah sent Nathan to David. And he came to him, and said to him, There were two men in one city; the one rich, and the other poor.
<DT><A NAME="12:2">12:2</A><DD>The rich had very many flocks and herds;
<DT><A NAME="12:3">12:3</A><DD>but the poor man had nothing at all, but one little ewe lamb which he had bought, and was nourishing; and it grew up with him, and together with his children: it ate of his morsel, and drank of his own cup, and slept in his bosom, and was to him as a daughter.
<DT><A NAME="12:4">12:4</A><DD>And there came a traveller to the rich man, and he spared to take of his own flock and of his own herd, to dress for the wayfaring man that had come to him; and he took the poor man's lamb, and dressed it for the man that had come to him.
<DT><A NAME="12:5">12:5</A><DD>Then David's anger was greatly kindled against the man; and he said to Nathan, As Jehovah liveth, the man that hath done this thing is worthy of <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2sa?n=12:5">death</A>;
<DT><A NAME="12:6">12:6</A><DD>and he shall restore the lamb fourfold, because he did this thing, and because he had no pity.
<DT><A NAME="12:7">12:7</A><DD>And Nathan said to David, Thou art the man! Thus saith Jehovah the God of Israel: I anointed thee king over Israel, and I delivered thee out of the hand of Saul;
<DT><A NAME="12:8">12:8</A><DD>and I gave thee thy master's house, and thy master's wives into thy bosom, and gave thee the house of Israel and of Judah; and if <I>that</I> had been too little, I would moreover have given unto thee such and such things.
<DT><A NAME="12:9">12:9</A><DD>Wherefore hast thou despised the word of Jehovah to do evil in his sight? thou hast smitten Urijah the Hittite with the sword, and hast taken his wife to be thy wife, and hast slain him with the sword of the children of Ammon.
<DT><A NAME="12:10">12:10</A><DD>Now therefore the sword shall never depart from thy house; because thou hast despised me, and hast taken the wife of Urijah the Hittite to be thy wife.
<DT><A NAME="12:11">12:11</A><DD>Thus saith Jehovah: Behold, I will raise up evil against thee out of thine own house, and I will take thy wives before thine eyes, and give them unto thy neighbour, and he shall lie with thy wives in the sight of this sun.
<DT><A NAME="12:12">12:12</A><DD>For thou didst <I>it</I> secretly; but I will do this thing before all Israel and before the sun.
<DT><A NAME="12:13">12:13</A><DD>And David said to Nathan, I have sinned against Jehovah. And Nathan said to David, Jehovah has also put away thy sin: thou shalt not die.
<DT><A NAME="12:14">12:14</A><DD>Howbeit, because by this deed thou hast given great occasion to the enemies of Jehovah to blaspheme, even the child that is born to thee shall certainly die.
<DT><A NAME="12:15">12:15</A><DD>And Nathan departed to his house. And Jehovah smote the child that Urijah's wife bore to David, and it became very <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2sa?n=12:15">sick</A>.
<DT><A NAME="12:16">12:16</A><DD>And David besought God for the child; and David fasted, and went in, and lay all night on the earth.
<DT><A NAME="12:17">12:17</A><DD>And the elders of his house arose, <I>and went</I> to him, to raise him up from the earth; but he would not, and he ate no bread with them.
<DT><A NAME="12:18">12:18</A><DD>And it came to pass on the seventh day, that the child died. And the servants of David feared to tell him that the child was dead; for they said, Behold, while the child was yet alive, we spoke to him, and he would not hearken to our voice; and how shall we say to him, The child is dead? he may do some harm.
<DT><A NAME="12:19">12:19</A><DD>But David saw that his servants whispered, and David perceived that the child was dead; and David said to his servants, Is the child dead? And they said, He is dead.
<DT><A NAME="12:20">12:20</A><DD>Then David arose from the earth, and washed, and anointed himself, and changed his clothing, and entered into the house of Jehovah and worshipped; then he came to his own house and required them to set bread before him, and he ate.
<DT><A NAME="12:21">12:21</A><DD>And his servants said to him, What thing is this which thou hast done? thou didst fast and weep for the child alive; but as soon as the child is dead, thou dost rise and eat bread.
<DT><A NAME="12:22">12:22</A><DD>And he said, While the child was yet alive, I fasted and wept; for I <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2sa?n=12:22">thought</A>, Who knows? <I>perhaps</I> Jehovah will be gracious to me, that the child may live.
<DT><A NAME="12:23">12:23</A><DD>But now he is dead, why should I fast? can I bring him back again? I shall go to him, but he will not return to me.
<DT><A NAME="12:24">12:24</A><DD>And David comforted Bathsheba his wife, and went in to her and lay with her; and she bore a son, and he called his name <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2sa?n=12:24">Solomon</A>; and Jehovah loved him.
<DT><A NAME="12:25">12:25</A><DD>And he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet; and he called his name <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2sa?n=12:25">Jedidiah</A>, for Jehovah's sake.
<DT><A NAME="12:26">12:26</A><DD>And Joab fought against Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and took the royal city.
<DT><A NAME="12:27">12:27</A><DD>And Joab sent messengers to David, and said, I have fought against Rabbah, and have taken the city of waters.
<DT><A NAME="12:28">12:28</A><DD>And now gather the rest of the people, and encamp against the city and take it: lest I take the city and it be called by my name.
<DT><A NAME="12:29">12:29</A><DD>And David gathered all the people, and went to Rabbah, and fought against it and took it.
<DT><A NAME="12:30">12:30</A><DD>And he took the crown of their king from off his head, the weight of which was a talent of gold with <I>the</I> precious stones; and it was <I>set</I> on David's head; and he brought forth the spoil of the city in great abundance.
<DT><A NAME="12:31">12:31</A><DD>And he brought out the people that were in it, and put them under the saw, and under harrows of iron, and under axes of iron, and made them pass through the brickkilns.

<DT><A NAME="13:1">13:1</A><DD>And it came to pass after this, that Absalom the son of David having a beautiful sister, whose name was Tamar, Amnon the son of David loved her.
<DT><A NAME="13:2">13:2</A><DD>And Amnon was so vexed, that he fell sick for his sister Tamar; for she was a virgin; and it seemed difficult for Amnon to do the least thing to her.
<DT><A NAME="13:3">13:3</A><DD>And Amnon had a friend whose name was Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David's brother; and Jonadab was a very shrewd man.
<DT><A NAME="13:4">13:4</A><DD>And he said to him, Why dost thou, the king's son, get thinner from morning to morning? Wilt thou not tell me? And Amnon said to him, I love Tamar, my brother Absalom's sister.
<DT><A NAME="13:5">13:5</A><DD>And Jonadab said to him, Lay thee down on thy bed and feign thyself sick; and when thy father comes to see thee, say to him, I pray thee, let my sister Tamar come, and give me food, and dress the food in my sight, that I may see it, and eat it from her hand.
<DT><A NAME="13:6">13:6</A><DD>So Amnon lay down and feigned himself sick; and the king came to see him, and Amnon said to the king, I pray thee, let Tamar my sister come, and make a couple of cakes in my sight, that I may eat from her hand.
<DT><A NAME="13:7">13:7</A><DD>And David sent home to Tamar, saying, Go, I pray thee, to thy brother Amnon's house, and dress him food.
<DT><A NAME="13:8">13:8</A><DD>And Tamar went to her brother Amnon's house; and he had lain down. And she took flour and kneaded it, and made cakes in his sight, and baked the cakes.
<DT><A NAME="13:9">13:9</A><DD>And she took the pan, and poured them out before him; but he refused to eat. And Amnon said, Put every man out from me. And they went out every man from him.

<DT><A NAME="13:13">13:13</A><DD>And I, whither shall I carry my reproach? and thou wouldest be as one of the infamous in Israel. And now, I pray thee, speak to the king; for he will not withhold me from thee.
<DT><A NAME="13:14">13:14</A><DD>But he would not hearken to her voice, and was stronger than she, and humbled her and lay with her.
<DT><A NAME="13:15">13:15</A><DD>And Amnon hated her with an exceeding great hatred, for the hatred with which he hated her was greater than the love with which he had loved her. And Amnon said to her, Arise, be gone.
<DT><A NAME="13:16">13:16</A><DD>And she said to him, There is no cause for this evil in sending me away, <I>which</I> is greater than the other that thou didst to me. But he would not hearken to her.
<DT><A NAME="13:17">13:17</A><DD>Then he called his young man that attended upon him, and said, Put now this <I>woman</I> out from me, and bolt the door after her.
<DT><A NAME="13:18">13:18</A><DD>Now she had a vest of many <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2sa?n=13:18">colours</A> upon her; for so were the king's daughters that were virgins apparelled. And his attendant brought her out, and bolted the door after her.
<DT><A NAME="13:19">13:19</A><DD>And Tamar put ashes on her head, and rent her vest of many colours which was on her, and laid her hand on her head, and went away, crying out as she went.
<DT><A NAME="13:20">13:20</A><DD>And Absalom her brother said to her, Has Amnon thy brother been with thee? and now, my sister, be still: he is thy brother; take not this thing to heart. And Tamar remained, and <I>that</I> desolate, in her brother Absalom's house.
<DT><A NAME="13:21">13:21</A><DD>And king David heard of all these things, and he was very angry.

<DT><A NAME="14:33">14:33</A><DD>And Joab came to the king, and told him. And he called Absalom, and he came to the king, and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king; and the king kissed Absalom.

<DT><A NAME="18:3">18:3</A><DD>But the people said, Thou shalt not go forth, for if we should in any case flee, they will not care for us; neither if half of us die, will they care for us; <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2sa?n=18:3">for</A> *thou* art worth ten thousand of us; and now it is better that thou succour us out of the city.
<DT><A NAME="18:4">18:4</A><DD>And the king said to them, I will do what is good in your sight. And the king stood by the gate-side, and all the people came out by hundreds and by thousands.
<DT><A NAME="18:5">18:5</A><DD>And the king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying, <I>Deal</I> gently for my sake with the young man Absalom. And all the people heard when the king gave all the captains charge concerning Absalom.
<DT><A NAME="18:6">18:6</A><DD>And the people went out into the field against Israel; and the battle was in the forest of Ephraim.
<DT><A NAME="18:7">18:7</A><DD>And the people of Israel were routed before the servants of David, and there was a great slaughter there that day: twenty thousand men.
<DT><A NAME="18:8">18:8</A><DD>And the battle was there scattered over the face of all the country; and the forest devoured more people that day than the sword devoured.
<DT><A NAME="18:9">18:9</A><DD>And Absalom found himself in the presence of David's servants. And Absalom was riding upon a mule, and the mule went under the thick boughs of the great terebinth, and his head caught in the terebinth, and he was taken up between the heaven and the earth; and the mule that was under him went away.
<DT><A NAME="18:10">18:10</A><DD>And a man saw it, and told Joab, and said, Behold, I saw Absalom hanging in a terebinth.
<DT><A NAME="18:11">18:11</A><DD>And Joab said to the man that told him, And behold, thou sawest <I>him</I>, and why didst thou not smite him there to the ground? and I would have given thee ten silver pieces and a girdle.
<DT><A NAME="18:12">18:12</A><DD>And the man said to Joab, Though I should receive a thousand silver pieces in my hand, yet would I not put forth my hand against the king's son; for in our hearing the king charged thee and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Take care, whoever it be <I>of <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2sa?n=18:12">you</A>,</I> of the young man Absalom.
<DT><A NAME="18:13">18:13</A><DD>Or I should have acted falsely against mine own life, for there is no matter <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2sa?n=18:13">concealed</A> from the king, and thou wouldest have set thyself against <I>me</I>.
<DT><A NAME="18:14">18:14</A><DD>Then said Joab, I may not tarry thus with thee. And he took three <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2sa?n=18:14">spears</A> in his hand, and thrust them into Absalom's <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2sa?n=18:14a">body</A>, while he was yet alive in the midst of the terebinth.
<DT><A NAME="18:15">18:15</A><DD>And ten young men that bore Joab's armour surrounded and smote Absalom, and killed him.
<DT><A NAME="18:16">18:16</A><DD>And Joab blew the trumpet, and the people returned from pursuing after Israel; for Joab kept <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2sa?n=18:16">back</A> the people.
<DT><A NAME="18:17">18:17</A><DD>And they took Absalom, and cast him into a great pit in the wood, and raised a very great heap of stones upon him. And all Israel fled every one to his tent.
<DT><A NAME="18:18">18:18</A><DD>Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for himself a monument, which is in the king's dale; for he said, I have no son to keep my name in remembrance; and he called the monument after his own name; and it is called unto this day, Absalom's memorial.
<DT><A NAME="18:19">18:19</A><DD>And Ahimaaz the son of Zadok said, Let me run, I pray, and carry the king the news that Jehovah has avenged him of his enemies.
<DT><A NAME="18:20">18:20</A><DD>And Joab said to him, Thou shalt not be a bearer of news to-day, but thou shalt carry the news another day; but to-day thou shalt carry no news, because the king's son is dead.
<DT><A NAME="18:21">18:21</A><DD>Then said Joab to the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2sa?n=18:21">Cushite</A>, Go, tell the king what thou hast seen. And the Cushite bowed himself to Joab, and ran.
<DT><A NAME="18:22">18:22</A><DD>And Ahimaaz the son of Zadok said yet again to Joab, Come what may, let me, I pray thee, also run after the Cushite. And Joab said, Why wilt thou run, my son, seeing that there is no news suited <I>to thee</I>?
<DT><A NAME="18:23">18:23</A><DD>-- But, come what may, let me run. And he said to him, Run. And Ahimaaz ran by the way of the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2sa?n=18:23">plain</A>, and outstripped the Cushite.
<DT><A NAME="18:24">18:24</A><DD>And David sat between the two gates; and the watchman went up to the roof of the gate, on to the wall, and lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, a man running alone.
<DT><A NAME="18:25">18:25</A><DD>And the watchman cried, and told the king. And the king said, If he be alone, there is news in his mouth. And he came on and drew near.
<DT><A NAME="18:26">18:26</A><DD>And the watchman saw another man running; and the watchman called to the porter and said, Behold a man running alone. And the king said, He also is a bearer of news.
<DT><A NAME="18:27">18:27</A><DD>And the watchman said, I see the running of the foremost like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok. And the king said, He is a good man; and comes with good news.
<DT><A NAME="18:28">18:28</A><DD>And Ahimaaz called and said to the king, Peace! And he fell down to the earth on his face before the king, and said, Blessed be Jehovah thy God, who has delivered up the men that lifted up their hand against my lord the king.
<DT><A NAME="18:29">18:29</A><DD>And the king said, Is it well with the young man Absalom? And Ahimaaz said, I saw a great tumult when Joab sent the king's servant, and me thy servant; but I knew not what it was.
<DT><A NAME="18:30">18:30</A><DD>And the king said, Turn aside <I>and</I> stand here. And he turned aside and stood still.
<DT><A NAME="18:31">18:31</A><DD>And behold, the Cushite came; and the Cushite said, Let my lord the king receive good tidings, for Jehovah has avenged thee this day of all them that rose up against thee.
<DT><A NAME="18:32">18:32</A><DD>And the king said to the Cushite, Is it well with the young man Absalom? And the Cushite said, The enemies of my lord the king, and all that rise against thee for evil, be as that young man.
<DT><A NAME="18:33">18:33</A><DD>And the king was much moved, and went up to the upper chamber of the gate, and wept; and as he went, he said thus: O my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! would God I had died in thy stead, O Absalom, my son, my son!
</DL></DIV><H2>Chapter 19</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="19:1">19:1</A><DD>And it was told Joab, Behold, the king weeps and mourns for Absalom.
<DT><A NAME="19:2">19:2</A><DD>And the victory that day was <I>turned</I> into mourning for all the people; for the people heard say that day, The king is grieved for his son.
<DT><A NAME="19:3">19:3</A><DD>And the people stole away that day into the city, as people steal away when ashamed of fleeing in battle.
<DT><A NAME="19:4">19:4</A><DD>And the king covered his face, and the king cried with a loud voice, My son Absalom! Absalom, my son, my son!
<DT><A NAME="19:5">19:5</A><DD>And Joab came into the house to the king, and said, Thou hast put to shame this day the faces of all thy servants who have this day saved thy life, and the lives of thy sons and of thy daughters, and the lives of thy wives and the lives of thy concubines;
<DT><A NAME="19:6">19:6</A><DD>in that thou lovest them that hate thee, and hatest those that love thee. For thou hast declared this day, that neither princes nor servants are anything to thee: for to-day I perceive, that if Absalom had lived, and all we had died to-day, then it would have been right in thine eyes.
<DT><A NAME="19:7">19:7</A><DD>But now arise, go forth, and speak consolingly to thy servants; for I swear by Jehovah, if thou go not forth, there will not tarry one with thee this night; and that would be worse to thee than all the evil that has befallen thee from thy youth until now.
<DT><A NAME="19:8">19:8</A><DD>Then the king arose, and sat in the gate. And they told all the people, saying, Behold, the king is sitting in the gate. And all the people came before the king. Now Israel had fled every man to his tent.
<DT><A NAME="19:9">19:9</A><DD>And all the people were at strife throughout the tribes of Israel, saying, The king delivered us out of the hand of our enemies, and he saved us out of the hand of the Philistines; and now he is fled out of the land because of Absalom.
<DT><A NAME="19:10">19:10</A><DD>And Absalom, whom we anointed over us, is dead in battle; and now why are ye silent as to bringing the king back?
<DT><A NAME="19:11">19:11</A><DD>And king David sent to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, saying, Speak to the elders of Judah saying, Why are ye the last to bring the king back to his house? seeing the speech of all Israel is come to the king, to his house.
<DT><A NAME="19:12">19:12</A><DD>Ye are my brethren, ye are my bone and my flesh; and why will ye be the last to bring back the king?
<DT><A NAME="19:13">19:13</A><DD>And say to Amasa, Art thou not my bone and my flesh? God do so to me and more also, if thou be not captain of the host before me continually instead of Joab.
<DT><A NAME="19:14">19:14</A><DD>And he bowed the heart of all the men of Judah as of one man; and they sent to the king, Return, thou and all thy servants.
<DT><A NAME="19:15">19:15</A><DD>And the king returned and came as far as the Jordan. And Judah came to Gilgal, to go to meet the king, to conduct the king over the Jordan.
<DT><A NAME="19:16">19:16</A><DD>And Shimei the son of Gera, the Benjaminite, who was of Bahurim, hasted and came down with the men of Judah to meet king David.
<DT><A NAME="19:17">19:17</A><DD>And there were a thousand men of Benjamin with him, and Ziba the servant of the house of Saul, and his fifteen sons and his twenty servants with him; and they forded the Jordan before the king.
<DT><A NAME="19:18">19:18</A><DD>And a ferry boat passed to and fro to carry over the king's household, and to do what he thought good. And Shimei the son of Gera fell down before the king as he was <I>just</I> crossing over the Jordan.
<DT><A NAME="19:19">19:19</A><DD>And he said to the king, Let not my lord impute iniquity to me, neither do thou remember that which thy servant did perversely the day that my lord the king went out of Jerusalem, that the king should take it to heart.
<DT><A NAME="19:20">19:20</A><DD>For thy servant knows that I have sinned; and behold, I am come the first this day of all the house of Joseph to go down to meet my lord the king.
<DT><A NAME="19:21">19:21</A><DD>And Abishai the son of Zeruiah answered and said, Should not Shimei be put to death for this, because he cursed Jehovah's anointed?
<DT><A NAME="19:22">19:22</A><DD>And David said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah, that ye should this day be adversaries to me? Should there any man be put to death this day in Israel? for do not I know that I am this day king over Israel?
<DT><A NAME="19:23">19:23</A><DD>And the king said to Shimei, Thou shalt not die. And the king swore to him.
<DT><A NAME="19:24">19:24</A><DD>And Mephibosheth the son of Saul came down to meet the king. Now he had neither <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2sa?n=19:24">washed</A> his feet, nor <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2sa?n=19:24">trimmed</A> his beard, nor washed his clothes, from the day the king departed until the day he came <I>again</I> in peace.
<DT><A NAME="19:25">19:25</A><DD>And as soon as Jerusalem <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2sa?n=19:25">came</A> to meet the king, the king said to him, Why didst thou not go with me, Mephibosheth?
<DT><A NAME="19:26">19:26</A><DD>And he said, My lord, O king, my servant deceived me; for thy servant said, I will saddle me the ass, and ride thereon, and go with the king; for thy servant is lame.
<DT><A NAME="19:27">19:27</A><DD>And he has slandered thy servant to my lord the king; but my lord the king is as an angel of God; do therefore what is good in thy sight.
<DT><A NAME="19:28">19:28</A><DD>For all my father's house were but dead men before my lord the king; and thou didst set thy servant among them that eat at thine own table. What further right therefore have I? and for what should I cry any more to the king?
<DT><A NAME="19:29">19:29</A><DD>And the king said to him, Why speakest thou any more of thy matters? I have said, Thou and Ziba divide the land.
<DT><A NAME="19:30">19:30</A><DD>And Mephibosheth said to the king, Let him even take all, since my lord the king is come again in peace to his own house.
<DT><A NAME="19:31">19:31</A><DD>And Barzillai the Gileadite came down from Rogelim, and went over the Jordan with the king, to conduct him over the Jordan.
<DT><A NAME="19:32">19:32</A><DD>And Barzillai was very aged, eighty years old; and it was he that had maintained the king while he abode at Mahanaim; for he was a very <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2sa?n=19:32">great</A> man.
<DT><A NAME="19:33">19:33</A><DD>And the king said to Barzillai, Pass thou over with me, and I will maintain thee with me in Jerusalem.
<DT><A NAME="19:34">19:34</A><DD>And Barzillai said to the king, How many are the days of the years of my life, that I should go up with the king to Jerusalem?
<DT><A NAME="19:35">19:35</A><DD>I am this day eighty years old: can I discern between good and bad? can thy servant taste what I eat and what I drink? can I hear any more the voice of singing men and singing women? and why should thy servant be yet a burden to my lord the king?
<DT><A NAME="19:36">19:36</A><DD>Thy servant will go a little <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2sa?n=19:36">way</A> over the Jordan with the king; and why should the king recompense it to me with this reward?
<DT><A NAME="19:37">19:37</A><DD>Let thy servant, I pray thee, turn back again, that I may die in mine own city, by the grave of my father and of my mother. But behold thy servant <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2sa?n=19:37">Chimham</A>: let him go over with my lord the king; and do to him what seems good to thee.
<DT><A NAME="19:38">19:38</A><DD>And the king said, Chimham shall go over with me, and I will do to him that which seems good to thee; and whatsoever thou shalt require of me, that will I do for thee.
<DT><A NAME="19:39">19:39</A><DD>And all the people went over the Jordan; and the king went over; and the king kissed Barzillai, and blessed him; and he returned to his own place.
<DT><A NAME="19:40">19:40</A><DD>And the king went on to Gilgal, and Chimham went on with him; and all the people of Judah conducted the king, and also half the people of Israel.
<DT><A NAME="19:41">19:41</A><DD>And behold, all the men of Israel came to the king, and said to the king, Why have our brethren the men of Judah stolen thee away, and have brought the king, and his household, and all David's men with him, over the Jordan?
<DT><A NAME="19:42">19:42</A><DD>And all the men of Judah answered the men of Israel, Because the king is near of kin to me; and why then are ye angry for this matter? have we eaten anything which came from the king, or has he given us any present?
<DT><A NAME="19:43">19:43</A><DD>And the men of Israel answered the men of Judah and said, I have ten parts in the king and I have also more right in David than thou; and why didst thou slight me? and was not my advice the first, to bring back my king? And the words of the men of Judah were harsher than the words of the men of Israel.

<DT><A NAME="20:1">20:1</A><DD>And there happened to be there a man of Belial, whose name was Sheba, the son of Bichri, a Benjaminite; and he blew a trumpet, and said, We have no portion in David, neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: every man to his tents, Israel.
<DT><A NAME="20:2">20:2</A><DD>Then all the men of Israel went up from after David, following Sheba the son of Bichri. But the men of Judah clave to their king, from the Jordan even to Jerusalem.
<DT><A NAME="20:3">20:3</A><DD>And David came to his house at Jerusalem; and the king took the ten women, concubines, whom he had left to keep the house, and put them in a house of confinement and maintained them, but did not go in to them. So they were shut up unto the day of their death, living in widowhood.
<DT><A NAME="20:4">20:4</A><DD>And the king said to Amasa, Call me the men of Judah together within three days, and do thou attend here.
<DT><A NAME="20:5">20:5</A><DD>So Amasa went to call together <I>the men of</I> Judah; but he delayed longer than the set time which he had appointed him.
<DT><A NAME="20:6">20:6</A><DD>And David said to Abishai, Now shall Sheba the son of Bichri do us more harm than did Absalom. Take thou thy lord's servants, and pursue after him, lest he get him fortified cities and escape our sight.
<DT><A NAME="20:7">20:7</A><DD>And there went out after him Joab's men, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, and all the mighty men; and they went out of Jerusalem, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri.
<DT><A NAME="20:8">20:8</A><DD>When they were at the great stone which is in Gibeon, Amasa came before them. And Joab was girded with his coat, his dress, and upon it was the girdle of the sword which was fastened on his loins in its sheath; and as he went forth it fell out.
<DT><A NAME="20:9">20:9</A><DD>And Joab said to Amasa, Art thou well, my brother? And Joab took Amasa by the beard with the right hand to kiss him.

<DT><A NAME="21:3">21:3</A><DD>And David said to the Gibeonites, What shall I do for you? and with what shall I make atonement, that ye may bless the inheritance of Jehovah?
<DT><A NAME="21:4">21:4</A><DD>And the Gibeonites said to him, As to Saul and his house, it is with us no question of receiving silver or gold, neither is it for us to have any man put to death in Israel. And he said, What ye say will I do for you.
