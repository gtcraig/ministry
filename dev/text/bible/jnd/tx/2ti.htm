<DT><A NAME="1:2">1:2</A><DD>to Timotheus, <I>my</I> beloved child: grace, mercy, peace, from God <I>the</I> Father, and Christ Jesus our Lord.
<DT><A NAME="1:3">1:3</A><DD>I am thankful to God, whom I <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2ti?n=1:3">serve</A> from <I>my</I> forefathers with pure conscience, how unceasingly I have the remembrance of thee in my supplications night and day,
<DT><A NAME="1:4">1:4</A><DD>earnestly desiring to see thee, remembering thy tears, that I may be filled with joy;
<DT><A NAME="1:5">1:5</A><DD>calling to <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2ti?n=1:5">mind</A> the unfeigned faith which <I>has <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2ti?n=1:5a">been</A></I> in thee, which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and in thy mother Eunice, and I am persuaded that in thee also.
<DT><A NAME="1:6">1:6</A><DD>For which cause I put thee in mind to <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2ti?n=1:6">rekindle</A> the gift of God which is in thee by the putting on of my hands.
<DT><A NAME="1:7">1:7</A><DD>For God has not given us a spirit of cowardice, but of power, and of love, and of wise <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2ti?n=1:7">discretion</A>.
<DT><A NAME="1:8">1:8</A><DD>Be not therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner; but suffer evil along with the glad <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2ti?n=1:8">tidings</A>, according to the power of God;
<DT><A NAME="1:9">1:9</A><DD>who has saved us, and has called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to <I>his</I> own purpose and grace, which <I>was</I> given to us in Christ Jesus before <I>the</I> ages of time,
<DT><A NAME="1:10">1:10</A><DD>but has been made manifest now by the appearing of our Saviour Jesus Christ, who has annulled death, and brought to light life and incorruptibility by the glad tidings;
<DT><A NAME="1:11">1:11</A><DD>to which *I* have been appointed a <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2ti?n=1:11">herald</A> and apostle and teacher of <I>the</I> nations.
<DT><A NAME="1:12">1:12</A><DD>For which cause also I suffer these things; but I am not ashamed; for I know whom I have <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2ti?n=1:12">believed</A>, and am persuaded that he is able to keep for that day the deposit I have entrusted to him.
<DT><A NAME="1:13">1:13</A><DD><A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2ti?n=1:13">Have</A> an outline of sound words, which <I>words</I> thou hast heard of me, in faith and love which <I>are</I> in Christ Jesus.
<DT><A NAME="1:14">1:14</A><DD>Keep, by the Holy Spirit which dwells in us, the good deposit entrusted.
<DT><A NAME="1:15">1:15</A><DD>Thou knowest this, that all who <I>are</I> in Asia, of whom is Phygellus and Hermogenes, have turned away from me.
<DT><A NAME="1:16">1:16</A><DD>The Lord grant mercy to the house of Onesiphorus, for he has often refreshed me, and has not been ashamed of my chain;
<DT><A NAME="1:17">1:17</A><DD>but being in Rome sought me out very diligently, and found <I>me</I> --
<DT><A NAME="1:18">1:18</A><DD>the Lord grant to him to find mercy from <I>the</I> Lord in that day -- and how much service he rendered in Ephesus *thou* knowest best.

<DT><A NAME="2:3">2:3</A><DD>Take thy share in <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2ti?n=2:3">suffering</A> as a good soldier of Jesus <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2ti?n=2:3a">Christ</A>.
<DT><A NAME="2:4">2:4</A><DD>No one <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2ti?n=2:4">going</A> as a soldier entangles himself with the affairs of life, that he may please him who has enlisted him as a soldier.
<DT><A NAME="2:5">2:5</A><DD>And if also any one contend <I>in the games</I>, he is not crowned unless he contend lawfully.

<DT><A NAME="2:7">2:7</A><DD>Think of what I say, for the Lord will give thee understanding in all things.
<DT><A NAME="2:8">2:8</A><DD>Remember Jesus Christ raised from among <I>the</I> dead, of <I>the</I> seed of David, according to my glad tidings,
<DT><A NAME="2:9">2:9</A><DD>in which I suffer even unto bonds as an evil-doer: but the word of God is not bound.
<DT><A NAME="2:10">2:10</A><DD>For this cause I <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2ti?n=2:10">endure</A> all things for the sake of the elect, that *they* also may <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2ti?n=2:10a">obtain</A> the salvation which <I>is</I> in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.
<DT><A NAME="2:11">2:11</A><DD>The word <I>is</I> faithful; for if we have died together with <I>him</I>, we shall also live together;
<DT><A NAME="2:12">2:12</A><DD>if we <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2ti?n=2:10">endure</A>, we shall also reign together; if we deny, *he* also will deny us;
<DT><A NAME="2:13">2:13</A><DD>if we are unfaithful, *he* abides faithful, for he cannot deny himself.
<DT><A NAME="2:14">2:14</A><DD>Of these things put in remembrance, testifying earnestly before the Lord not to have disputes of words, profitable for nothing, to the subversion of the hearers.
<DT><A NAME="2:15">2:15</A><DD>Strive diligently to present thyself approved to God, a workman that has not to be ashamed, cutting in a straight line the word of truth.
<DT><A NAME="2:16">2:16</A><DD>But profane, vain babblings shun, for <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2ti?n=2:16">they</A> will advance to greater impiety,
<DT><A NAME="2:17">2:17</A><DD>and their word will spread as a gangrene; of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus;
<DT><A NAME="2:18">2:18</A><DD><I>men</I> who as to the truth have gone <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2ti?n=2:18">astray</A>, saying that the resurrection has taken place already; and overthrow the faith of some.
<DT><A NAME="2:19">2:19</A><DD><A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2ti?n=2:19">Yet</A> the firm foundation of God stands, having this seal, <I>The</I> Lord knows those that are his; and, Let every one who names the name of <I>the</I> Lord withdraw from iniquity.
<DT><A NAME="2:20">2:20</A><DD>But in a great house there are not only gold and silver vessels, but also wooden and earthen; and some to honour, and some to dishonour.
<DT><A NAME="2:21">2:21</A><DD>If therefore one shall have <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2ti?n=2:21">purified</A> himself from these, <I>in separating himself from them</I>, he shall be a vessel to honour, sanctified, serviceable to the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2ti?n=2:21a">Master</A>, prepared for every good work.
<DT><A NAME="2:22">2:22</A><DD>But youthful lusts flee, and pursue righteousness, faith, love, peace, with those that call upon the Lord out of a pure heart.
<DT><A NAME="2:23">2:23</A><DD>But foolish and <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2ti?n=2:23">senseless</A> questionings avoid, knowing that they beget contentions.
<DT><A NAME="2:24">2:24</A><DD>And a bondman of <I>the</I> Lord ought not to contend, but be gentle towards all; apt to <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2ti?n=2:24">teach</A>; forbearing;
<DT><A NAME="2:25">2:25</A><DD>in meekness setting right those who oppose, if God perhaps may sometime give them repentance to <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2ti?n=2:25">acknowledgment</A> of <I>the</I> truth,

<DT><A NAME="3:3">3:3</A><DD>without natural affection, implacable, slanderers, of unsubdued passions, savage, having no love for what is <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2ti?n=3:3">good</A>,
<DT><A NAME="3:4">3:4</A><DD>traitors, headlong, of vain pretensions, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God;
<DT><A NAME="3:5">3:5</A><DD>having a form of piety but denying the power of it: and from these turn away.
<DT><A NAME="3:6">3:6</A><DD>For of these are they who are getting into houses, and leading captive silly women, laden with sins, led by various lusts,

<DT><A NAME="3:8">3:8</A><DD>Now in the same manner in which Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, thus these also withstand the truth; men corrupted in mind, found worthless as regards the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2ti?n=3:8">faith</A>.
<DT><A NAME="3:9">3:9</A><DD>But they shall not advance farther; for their folly shall be completely manifest to all, as that of those also became.
<DT><A NAME="3:10">3:10</A><DD>But *thou* hast been thoroughly acquainted <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2ti?n=3:10">with</A> my teaching, conduct, purpose, faith, longsuffering, love, endurance,
<DT><A NAME="3:11">3:11</A><DD>persecutions, sufferings: what <I>sufferings</I> happened to me in Antioch, in Iconium, in Lystra; what persecutions I endured; and the Lord delivered me out of all.
<DT><A NAME="3:12">3:12</A><DD>And all indeed who desire to live piously in Christ Jesus will be persecuted.
<DT><A NAME="3:13">3:13</A><DD>But wicked men and juggling impostors shall advance in <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_2ti?n=3:13">evil</A>, leading and being led astray.
<DT><A NAME="3:14">3:14</A><DD>But *thou*, abide in those things which thou hast learned, and <I>of which</I> thou hast been fully persuaded, knowing of whom thou hast learned <I>them</I>;
<DT><A NAME="3:15">3:15</A><DD>and that from a child thou hast known the sacred letters, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation, through faith which <I>is</I> in Christ Jesus.

<DT><A NAME="4:3">4:3</A><DD>For the time shall be when they will not bear sound teaching; but according to their own lusts will heap up to themselves teachers, having an itching ear;
