<H2>Chapter 1</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="1:1">1:1</A><DD>Beginning of the glad tidings of Jesus Christ, Son of God;
<DT><A NAME="1:2">1:2</A><DD>as it is written in <I>Isaiah</I> the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mr?n=1:2">prophet</A>, Behold, *I* send my messenger before thy face, who shall prepare thy <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mr?n=1:2a">way</A>.
<DT><A NAME="1:3">1:3</A><DD>Voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare the way of <I>the</I> Lord, make his paths <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mr?n=1:3">straight</A>.
<DT><A NAME="1:4">1:4</A><DD>There came John baptising in the wilderness, and preaching <I>the</I> baptism of repentance for remission of sins.
<DT><A NAME="1:5">1:5</A><DD>And there went out to him all the district of Judaea, and all they of Jerusalem, and were baptised by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins.
<DT><A NAME="1:6">1:6</A><DD>And John was clothed in camel's hair, and a leathern girdle about his loins, and ate locusts and wild honey.
<DT><A NAME="1:7">1:7</A><DD>And he preached, saying, There comes he that is mightier than I after me, the thong of whose sandals I am not fit to stoop down and unloose.
<DT><A NAME="1:8">1:8</A><DD>*I* indeed have baptised you with water, but *he* shall baptise you with <I>the</I> Holy Spirit.
<DT><A NAME="1:9">1:9</A><DD>And it came to pass in those days <I>that</I> Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptised by John at the Jordan.
<DT><A NAME="1:10">1:10</A><DD>And straightway going up from the water, he saw the heavens parting asunder, and the Spirit, as a dove, descending upon him.
<DT><A NAME="1:11">1:11</A><DD>And there came a voice out of the heavens: *Thou* art my beloved Son, in thee I have found my delight.
<DT><A NAME="1:12">1:12</A><DD>And immediately the Spirit drives him out into the wilderness.
<DT><A NAME="1:13">1:13</A><DD>And he was in the wilderness forty days tempted by Satan, and was with the wild beasts; and the angels <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mr?n=1:13">ministered</A> to him.
<DT><A NAME="1:14">1:14</A><DD>But after John was delivered up, Jesus came into Galilee preaching the glad tidings of the kingdom of God,
<DT><A NAME="1:15">1:15</A><DD>and saying, <FONT CLASS=r>The time is fulfilled and the kingdom of God has drawn nigh; repent and believe <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mr?n=1:15">in</A> the glad tidings.</FONT>
<DT><A NAME="1:16">1:16</A><DD>And walking by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon, and Andrew, <I>Simon's</I> brother, casting out a net in the sea, for they were fishers.
<DT><A NAME="1:17">1:17</A><DD>And Jesus said to them, <FONT CLASS=r>Come after me, and I will make you become fishers of men;</FONT>
<DT><A NAME="1:18">1:18</A><DD>and straightway leaving their <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mr?n=1:18">trawl-nets</A> they followed him.
<DT><A NAME="1:19">1:19</A><DD>And going on thence a little, he saw James the <I>son</I> of Zebedee, and John his brother, and these <I>were</I> in the ship repairing the trawl-nets;
<DT><A NAME="1:20">1:20</A><DD>and straightway he called them; and leaving their father Zebedee in the ship with the hired servants, they went away after him.
<DT><A NAME="1:21">1:21</A><DD>And they go into Capernaum. And straightway on the sabbath he entered into the synagogue and taught.
<DT><A NAME="1:22">1:22</A><DD>And they were astonished at his doctrine, for he taught them as having authority, and not as the scribes.
<DT><A NAME="1:23">1:23</A><DD>And there was in their synagogue a man <I>possessed</I> <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mr?n=1:23">by</A> an unclean spirit, and he cried out
<DT><A NAME="1:24">1:24</A><DD>saying, <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mr?n=1:24">Eh</A>! what have we to do with thee, Jesus, <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mr?n=1:24a">Nazarene</A>? Art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art, the holy one of God.
<DT><A NAME="1:25">1:25</A><DD>And Jesus rebuked him, saying, <FONT CLASS=r>Hold thy peace and come out of him.</FONT>
<DT><A NAME="1:26">1:26</A><DD>And the unclean spirit, having torn him, and uttered a cry with a loud voice, came out of him.
<DT><A NAME="1:27">1:27</A><DD>And all were amazed, so that they questioned together among themselves, saying, What is this? what new doctrine is this? for with authority he commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey him.
<DT><A NAME="1:28">1:28</A><DD>And his fame went out straightway into the whole region of Galilee around.
<DT><A NAME="1:29">1:29</A><DD>And straightway going out of the synagogue, they came with James and John into the house of Simon and Andrew.
<DT><A NAME="1:30">1:30</A><DD>And the mother-in-law of Simon lay in a fever. And straightway they speak to him about her.
<DT><A NAME="1:31">1:31</A><DD>And he went up to <I>her</I> and raised her up, having taken her by the hand, and straightway the fever left her, and she served them.
<DT><A NAME="1:32">1:32</A><DD>But evening being come, when the sun had gone down, they brought to him all that were suffering, and those possessed by demons;
<DT><A NAME="1:33">1:33</A><DD>and the whole city was gathered together at the door.
<DT><A NAME="1:34">1:34</A><DD>And he healed many suffering from various diseases; and he cast out many demons, and did not suffer the demons to speak because they <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mr?n=1:34">knew</A> him.
<DT><A NAME="1:35">1:35</A><DD>And rising in the morning long before day, he went out and went away into a desert place, and there prayed.
<DT><A NAME="1:36">1:36</A><DD>And Simon and those with him went after him:
<DT><A NAME="1:37">1:37</A><DD>and having found him, they say to him, All seek thee.
<DT><A NAME="1:38">1:38</A><DD>And he says to them, <FONT CLASS=r>Let us go elsewhere into the neighbouring country towns, that I may preach there also, for for this purpose am I come forth.</FONT>
<DT><A NAME="1:39">1:39</A><DD>And he was preaching in their synagogues in the whole of Galilee, and casting out demons.
<DT><A NAME="1:40">1:40</A><DD>And there comes to him a leper, beseeching him, and falling on his knees to him, and saying to him, If thou wilt thou canst cleanse me.
<DT><A NAME="1:41">1:41</A><DD>But Jesus, moved with compassion, having stretched out his hand, <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mr?n=1:41">touched</A> him, and says to him, <FONT CLASS=r>I will, be thou cleansed.</FONT>
<DT><A NAME="1:42">1:42</A><DD>And as he spoke straightway the leprosy left him, and he was cleansed.
<DT><A NAME="1:43">1:43</A><DD>And having sharply charged him, he straightway sent him away,
<DT><A NAME="1:44">1:44</A><DD>and says to him, <FONT CLASS=r>See thou say nothing to any one, but go, shew thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing what Moses ordained, for a testimony to them.</FONT>
<DT><A NAME="1:45">1:45</A><DD>But he, having gone forth, began to proclaim <I>it</I> much, and to spread the matter abroad, so that he could no longer enter openly into the city, but was without in desert places, and they <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mr?n=1:45">came</A> to him from every side.
</DL></DIV><H2>Chapter 2</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="2:1">2:1</A><DD>And he entered again into Capernaum after <I>several</I> days, and it was reported that he was at <I>the</I> <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mr?n=2:1">house</A>;
<DT><A NAME="2:2">2:2</A><DD>and straightway many were gathered together, so that there was no longer any room, not even at the door; and he spoke the word to them.
<DT><A NAME="2:3">2:3</A><DD>And there come to him <I>men</I> bringing a paralytic, borne by four;
<DT><A NAME="2:4">2:4</A><DD>and, not being able to get near to him on account of the crowd, they uncovered the roof where he was, and having dug <I>it</I> up they let down the couch on which the paralytic lay.
<DT><A NAME="2:5">2:5</A><DD>But Jesus, seeing their faith, says to the paralytic, <FONT CLASS=r>Child, thy sins are forgiven <I>thee</I>.</FONT>
<DT><A NAME="2:6">2:6</A><DD>But certain of the scribes were there sitting, and reasoning in their hearts,
<DT><A NAME="2:7">2:7</A><DD>Why does this <I>man</I> thus speak? he blasphemes. Who is able to forgive sins except God alone?
<DT><A NAME="2:8">2:8</A><DD>And straightway Jesus, <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mr?n=2:8">knowing</A> in his spirit that they are reasoning thus within themselves, said to them, <FONT CLASS=r>Why reason ye these things in your hearts?</FONT>
<DT><A NAME="2:9">2:9</A><DD><FONT CLASS=r>Which is easier, to say to the paralytic, <I>Thy</I> sins are forgiven <I>thee</I>; or to say, Arise, and take up thy couch and walk?</FONT>
<DT><A NAME="2:10">2:10</A><DD><FONT CLASS=r>But that ye may know that the Son of man has <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mr?n=2:10">power</A> on earth to forgive sins,</FONT> he says to the paralytic,
<DT><A NAME="2:11">2:11</A><DD><FONT CLASS=r>To thee I say, Arise, take up thy couch and go to thine house.</FONT>
<DT><A NAME="2:12">2:12</A><DD>And he rose up straightway, and, having taken up his couch, went out before <I>them</I> all, so that all were amazed, and glorified God, saying, We never saw it thus.
<DT><A NAME="2:13">2:13</A><DD>And he went out again by the sea, and all the crowd <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mr?n=1:45">came</A> to him, and he taught them.
<DT><A NAME="2:14">2:14</A><DD>And passing by, he saw Levi the <I>son</I> of Alphaeus sitting at the tax-office, and says to him, <FONT CLASS=r>Follow me.</FONT> And he rose up and followed him.
<DT><A NAME="2:15">2:15</A><DD>And it came to pass as he lay at table in his house, that many tax-gatherers and sinners lay at table with Jesus and his disciples; for they were many, and they followed him.
<DT><A NAME="2:16">2:16</A><DD>And the scribes and the Pharisees, seeing him eating with sinners and tax-gatherers, said to his disciples, Why <I>is it</I> that he eats and drinks with tax-gatherers and sinners?
<DT><A NAME="2:17">2:17</A><DD>And Jesus having heard <I>it</I> says to them, <FONT CLASS=r>They that are strong have not need of a physician, but those who are ill. I have not come to call righteous <I>men</I>, but sinners.</FONT>
<DT><A NAME="2:18">2:18</A><DD>And the disciples of John and the Pharisees were fasting; and they come and say to him, Why do the disciples of John and <I>the disciples</I> of the Pharisees fast, but thy disciples fast not?
<DT><A NAME="2:19">2:19</A><DD>And Jesus said to them, <FONT CLASS=r>Can the sons of the bride-chamber fast while the bridegroom is with them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them they cannot fast.</FONT>
<DT><A NAME="2:20">2:20</A><DD><FONT CLASS=r>But days will come when the bridegroom shall have been taken away from them, and then shall they fast in that day.</FONT>
<DT><A NAME="2:21">2:21</A><DD><FONT CLASS=r>No one sews a patch of <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mr?n=2:21">new</A> cloth on an old garment: otherwise its new filling-up takes from the old <I>stuff</I>, and there is a worse rent.</FONT>
<DT><A NAME="2:22">2:22</A><DD><FONT CLASS=r>And no one puts new wine into old skins; otherwise the wine bursts the skins, and the wine is poured out, and the skins will be destroyed; but new wine is to be put into new skins.</FONT>
<DT><A NAME="2:23">2:23</A><DD>And it came to pass that he went on the sabbath through the cornfields; and his disciples began to walk on, plucking the ears.
<DT><A NAME="2:24">2:24</A><DD>And the Pharisees said to him, Behold, why do they on the sabbath what is not lawful?
<DT><A NAME="2:25">2:25</A><DD>And *he* said to them, <FONT CLASS=r>Have ye never read what David did when he had need and hungered, *he* and those with him,</FONT>
<DT><A NAME="2:26">2:26</A><DD><FONT CLASS=r>how he entered into the house of God, in <I>the section <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mr?n=2:26">of</A></I> Abiathar <I>the</I> high priest, and ate the shew-bread, which it is not lawful unless for the priests to eat, and gave even to those that were with him?</FONT>
<DT><A NAME="2:27">2:27</A><DD>And he said to them, <FONT CLASS=r>The sabbath was made on account of man, not man on account of the sabbath;</FONT>

</DL></DIV><H2>Chapter 3</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="3:1">3:1</A><DD>And he entered again into the synagogue; and there was there a man having his hand dried up.
<DT><A NAME="3:2">3:2</A><DD>And they watched him if he would heal him on the sabbath, that they might accuse him.
<DT><A NAME="3:3">3:3</A><DD>And he says to the man who had his hand dried up, <FONT CLASS=r>Rise up <I>and come</I> into the midst.</FONT>
<DT><A NAME="3:4">3:4</A><DD>And he says to them, <FONT CLASS=r>Is it lawful on the sabbath to do good or to do evil, to save life or to kill?</FONT> But they were silent.
<DT><A NAME="3:5">3:5</A><DD>And looking round upon them with anger, <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mr?n=3:5">distressed</A> at the hardening of their heart, he says to the man, <FONT CLASS=r>Stretch out thy hand.</FONT> And he stretched <I>it</I> out, and his hand was restored.
<DT><A NAME="3:6">3:6</A><DD>And the Pharisees going out straightway with the Herodians took <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mr?n=3:6">counsel</A> against him, how they might destroy him.
<DT><A NAME="3:7">3:7</A><DD>And Jesus withdrew with his disciples to the sea; and a great multitude from Galilee followed him, and from Judaea,
<DT><A NAME="3:8">3:8</A><DD>and from Jerusalem, and from Idumaea and beyond the Jordan; and they of around Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, having heard what things he did, came to him.
<DT><A NAME="3:9">3:9</A><DD>And he spoke to his disciples, in order that a little ship should wait upon him on account of the crowd, that they might not press upon him.
<DT><A NAME="3:10">3:10</A><DD>For he healed many, so that they beset him that they might touch him, as many as had plagues.
<DT><A NAME="3:11">3:11</A><DD>And the unclean spirits, when they beheld him, fell down before him, and cried saying, *Thou* art the Son of God.
<DT><A NAME="3:12">3:12</A><DD>And he rebuked them much, that they might not make him manifest.
<DT><A NAME="3:13">3:13</A><DD>And he goes up into the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mr?n=3:13">mountain</A>, and calls whom he himself would, and they went to him.
<DT><A NAME="3:14">3:14</A><DD>And he appointed twelve that they might be with him, and that he might send them to preach,

<DT><A NAME="3:20">3:20</A><DD>And again a crowd comes together, so that they cannot even eat bread.
<DT><A NAME="3:21">3:21</A><DD>And his relatives having heard <I>of it</I> went out to lay hold on him, for they said, He is out of his mind.
<DT><A NAME="3:22">3:22</A><DD>And the scribes who had come down from Jerusalem said, He has Beelzebub, and, <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mr?n=3:22">By</A> the prince of the demons he casts out demons.
<DT><A NAME="3:23">3:23</A><DD>And having called them to <I>him</I>, he said to them in parables, <FONT CLASS=r>How can Satan cast out Satan?</FONT>

<DT><A NAME="15:8">15:8</A><DD>And the crowd crying out began to beg <I>that he would do</I> to them as he had always done.
<DT><A NAME="15:9">15:9</A><DD>But Pilate answered them saying, Will ye that I release to you the King of the Jews?
<DT><A NAME="15:10">15:10</A><DD>for he knew that the chief priests had delivered him up through envy.
<DT><A NAME="15:11">15:11</A><DD>But the chief priests stirred up the crowd that he might rather release Barabbas to them.
<DT><A NAME="15:12">15:12</A><DD>And Pilate answering said to them again, What will ye then that I do <I>to him</I> whom ye call King of the Jews?
<DT><A NAME="15:13">15:13</A><DD>And they cried out again, Crucify him.
<DT><A NAME="15:14">15:14</A><DD>And Pilate said to them, What evil then has he done? But they cried out the more urgently, Crucify him.
<DT><A NAME="15:15">15:15</A><DD>And Pilate, desirous of contenting the crowd, released to them Barabbas, and delivered up Jesus, when he had scourged him, that he might be crucified.
<DT><A NAME="15:16">15:16</A><DD>And the soldiers led him away into the court which is <I>called the</I> praetorium, and they call together the whole <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mr?n=15:16">band</A>.
<DT><A NAME="15:17">15:17</A><DD>And they clothe him with purple, and bind round on him a crown of thorns which they had plaited.
<DT><A NAME="15:18">15:18</A><DD>And they began to salute him, Hail, King of the Jews!
<DT><A NAME="15:19">15:19</A><DD>And they struck his head with a reed, and spat on him, and, bending the knee, did him homage.
<DT><A NAME="15:20">15:20</A><DD>And when they had mocked him, they took the purple off him, and put his own clothes on him; and they lead him out that they may crucify him.
<DT><A NAME="15:21">15:21</A><DD>And they compel to go <I>with them</I> a certain passer-by, Simon, a Cyrenian, coming from the field, the father of Alexander and Rufus, that he might carry his cross.
<DT><A NAME="15:22">15:22</A><DD>And they bring him to the place <I>called</I> Golgotha, which, being interpreted, is Place of a skull.
<DT><A NAME="15:23">15:23</A><DD>And they offered him wine <I>to drink</I> medicated with myrrh; but he did not take <I>it</I>.
<DT><A NAME="15:24">15:24</A><DD>And having crucified him, they part his clothes amongst <I>themselves</I>, casting lots on them, what each one should take.
<DT><A NAME="15:25">15:25</A><DD>And it was the third hour, and they crucified him.
<DT><A NAME="15:26">15:26</A><DD>And the superscription of what he was accused of was written up: The King of the Jews.
<DT><A NAME="15:27">15:27</A><DD>And with him they crucify two robbers, one on his right hand, and one on his left.
<DT><A NAME="15:28">15:28</A><DD><I>And the scripture was fulfilled which says, And he was reckoned with the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mr?n=15:28">lawless</A>.</I>
<DT><A NAME="15:29">15:29</A><DD>And they that passed by reviled him, shaking their heads, and saying, Aha, thou that destroyest the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mr?n=15:29">temple</A> and buildest it in three days,
<DT><A NAME="15:30">15:30</A><DD>save thyself, and descend from the cross.
<DT><A NAME="15:31">15:31</A><DD>In like manner the chief priests also, with the scribes, mocking with one another, said, He saved others; himself he cannot save.
<DT><A NAME="15:32">15:32</A><DD>Let the Christ the King of Israel descend now from the cross, that we may see and may believe. And they that were crucified with him reproached him.
<DT><A NAME="15:33">15:33</A><DD>And when <I>the</I> sixth hour was come, there came darkness over the whole <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mr?n=15:33">land</A> until <I>the</I> ninth hour;
<DT><A NAME="15:34">15:34</A><DD>and at the ninth hour, Jesus cried with a loud voice, <I>saying</I>, <FONT CLASS=r>Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?</FONT> which is, being interpreted, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?
<DT><A NAME="15:35">15:35</A><DD>And some of those who stood by, when they heard <I>it</I>, said, Behold, he calls for Elias.
<DT><A NAME="15:36">15:36</A><DD>And one, running and filling a sponge with vinegar, fixed it on a reed, and gave him to drink, saying, Let alone, let us see if Elias comes to take him down.
<DT><A NAME="15:37">15:37</A><DD>And Jesus, having uttered a loud cry, expired.
<DT><A NAME="15:38">15:38</A><DD>And the veil of the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mr?n=15:38">temple</A> was rent in two from the top to the bottom.
<DT><A NAME="15:39">15:39</A><DD>And the centurion who stood by over against him, when he saw that he had expired having thus cried out, said, Truly this man was Son of God.
<DT><A NAME="15:40">15:40</A><DD>And there were women also looking on from afar off, among whom were both Mary of Magdala, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and Salome;
<DT><A NAME="15:41">15:41</A><DD>who also, when he was in Galilee, followed him and ministered to him; and many others who came up with him to Jerusalem.
<DT><A NAME="15:42">15:42</A><DD>And when it was already evening, since it was <I>the</I> preparation, that is, <I>the day</I> before a sabbath,
<DT><A NAME="15:43">15:43</A><DD>Joseph of Arimathaea, an honourable councillor, who also himself was awaiting the kingdom of God, coming, emboldened himself and went in to Pilate and begged the body of Jesus.
<DT><A NAME="15:44">15:44</A><DD>And Pilate wondered if he were already dead; and having called to <I>him</I> the centurion, he inquired of him if he had long died.
<DT><A NAME="15:45">15:45</A><DD>And when he knew from the centurion, he granted the body to Joseph.
<DT><A NAME="15:46">15:46</A><DD>And having bought fine linen, <I>and</I> having taken him down, he swathed him in the fine linen, and laid him in a sepulchre which was cut out of rock, and rolled a stone to the door of the sepulchre.
<DT><A NAME="15:47">15:47</A><DD>And Mary of Magdala and Mary the <I>mother</I> of Joses saw where he was put.

<DT><A NAME="16:1">16:1</A><DD>And the sabbath being <I>now</I> past, Mary of Magdala, and Mary the <I>mother</I> of James, and Salome, bought aromatic spices that they might come and embalm him.
<DT><A NAME="16:2">16:2</A><DD>And very early on the first <I>day</I> of the week they come to the sepulchre, the sun having risen.
<DT><A NAME="16:3">16:3</A><DD>And they said to one another, Who shall roll us away the stone out of the door of the sepulchre?
<DT><A NAME="16:4">16:4</A><DD>And when they looked, they see that the stone has been rolled <I>away</I>, for it was very great.
<DT><A NAME="16:5">16:5</A><DD>And entering into the sepulchre, they saw a young man sitting on the right, clothed in a white robe, and they were amazed and <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mr?n=16:5">alarmed</A>;
<DT><A NAME="16:6">16:6</A><DD>but he says to them, Be not <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mr?n=16:5">alarmed</A>. Ye seek Jesus, the Nazarene, the crucified one. He is risen, he is not here; behold the place where they had put him.
<DT><A NAME="16:7">16:7</A><DD>But go, tell his disciples and Peter, he goes before you into Galilee; there shall ye see him, as he said to you.
<DT><A NAME="16:8">16:8</A><DD>And they went out, and fled from the sepulchre. And trembling and excessive amazement possessed them, and they said nothing to any one, for they were afraid.
<DT><A NAME="16:9">16:9</A><DD>Now when he had risen very early, the first <I>day</I> of the week, he appeared first to Mary of Magdala, out of whom he had cast seven demons.
<DT><A NAME="16:10">16:10</A><DD>*She* went and brought word to those that had been with him, <I>who were</I> grieving and weeping.
<DT><A NAME="16:11">16:11</A><DD>And when these heard that he was alive and had been seen of her, they disbelieved <I>it</I>.
<DT><A NAME="16:12">16:12</A><DD>And after these things he was manifested in another form to two of them as they walked, going into the country;
<DT><A NAME="16:13">16:13</A><DD>and *they* went and brought word to the rest; neither did they believe them.
<DT><A NAME="16:14">16:14</A><DD>Afterwards as they lay at table he was manifested to the eleven, and reproached <I>them with</I> their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they had not believed those who had seen him risen.
<DT><A NAME="16:15">16:15</A><DD>And he said to them, <FONT CLASS=r>Go into all the world, and preach the glad tidings to all the creation.</FONT>
<DT><A NAME="16:16">16:16</A><DD><FONT CLASS=r>He that believes and is baptised shall be saved, and he that disbelieves shall be condemned.</FONT>
<DT><A NAME="16:17">16:17</A><DD><FONT CLASS=r>And these signs shall follow those that have believed: in my name they shall cast out demons; they shall speak with <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_mr?n=16:17">new</A> tongues;</FONT>

<DT><A NAME="16:19">16:19</A><DD>The Lord therefore, after he had spoken to them, was taken up into heaven, and sat at the right hand of God.
<DT><A NAME="16:20">16:20</A><DD>And they, going forth, preached everywhere, the Lord working with <I>them</I>, and confirming the word by the signs following upon <I>it</I>.
