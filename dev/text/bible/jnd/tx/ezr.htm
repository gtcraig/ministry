<DT><A NAME="4:16">4:16</A><DD>We inform the king that if this city be built and its walls be completed, by this means thou shalt have no portion on this side the river.
<DT><A NAME="4:17">4:17</A><DD>The king sent an answer to Rehum the chancellor, and Shimshai the scribe, and the rest of their companions that dwell in Samaria, and the other places beyond the river: Peace, and so forth.

<DT><A NAME="10:2">10:2</A><DD>And Shechaniah the son of Jehiel, of the sons of Elam, answered and said to Ezra, We have acted unfaithfully toward our God, and have taken foreign wives of the peoples of the land; yet now there is hope for Israel concerning this thing.
<DT><A NAME="10:3">10:3</A><DD>And now let us make a covenant with our God to put away all the wives, and such as are born of them, according to the counsel of <I>my</I> <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ezr?n=10:3">lord</A>, and of those that tremble at the commandments of our God; and let it be done according to the law.

<DT><A NAME="10:5">10:5</A><DD>Then Ezra arose, and made the chiefs of the priests, of the Levites, and of all Israel, to swear that they would do according to this word. And they swore.
<DT><A NAME="10:6">10:6</A><DD>And Ezra arose from before the house of God, and went into the chamber of Jehohanan the son of Eliashib; and when he came thither, he ate no bread and drank no water; for he mourned because of the unfaithfulness of them that had been carried away.
<DT><A NAME="10:7">10:7</A><DD>And they made proclamation in Judah and Jerusalem to all the children of the captivity, that they should gather themselves together unto Jerusalem;

<DT><A NAME="10:12">10:12</A><DD>And the whole congregation answered and said with a loud voice, Yes, it is for us to do according to thy words.
<DT><A NAME="10:13">10:13</A><DD>But the people are many, and it is a time of pouring rain, and it is not possible to stand without: neither is this a work for one day or two; for we are many that have transgressed in this thing.
<DT><A NAME="10:14">10:14</A><DD>Let now our princes, while this matter is going on, stand for all the congregation, and let all those that have taken foreign wives in our cities come at the appointed times, and with them the elders of every city, and the judges thereof, until the fierce anger of our God be turned from us.
<DT><A NAME="10:15">10:15</A><DD>Only Jonathan the son of Asahel and Jahzeiah the son of Tikvah stood up <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_ezr?n=10:15">against</A> this; and Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite helped them.
<DT><A NAME="10:16">10:16</A><DD>And the children of the captivity did so.
