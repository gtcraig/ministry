<H2>Chapter 1</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="1:1">1:1</A><DD>And king David was old <I>and</I> advanced in <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1ki?n=1:1">age</A>; and they covered him with clothes, but he obtained no warmth.
<DT><A NAME="1:2">1:2</A><DD>And his servants said to him, Let there be found for my lord the king a young virgin; and let her stand before the king, and let her cherish him, and let her lie in thy bosom, that my lord the king may get warm.
<DT><A NAME="1:3">1:3</A><DD>And they sought for a fair damsel throughout the territory of Israel, and found Abishag a Shunammite, and brought her to the king.
<DT><A NAME="1:4">1:4</A><DD>And the damsel was very fair; and cherished the king, and ministered to him; but the king knew her not.
<DT><A NAME="1:5">1:5</A><DD>And Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself, saying, I will be king; and he provided himself chariots and horsemen, and fifty men to run before him.
<DT><A NAME="1:6">1:6</A><DD>And his father had not grieved him at any time in saying, Why doest thou so? and he was also a very comely man; and <I>his mother</I> bore him after Absalom.
<DT><A NAME="1:7">1:7</A><DD>And he conferred with Joab the son of Zeruiah, and with Abiathar the priest; and they helped Adonijah and followed <I>him</I>.
<DT><A NAME="1:8">1:8</A><DD>But Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and Nathan the prophet, and Shimei, and Rei, and the mighty men whom David had, were not with Adonijah.
<DT><A NAME="1:9">1:9</A><DD>And Adonijah <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1ki?n=1:9">sacrificed</A> sheep and oxen and fatted cattle by the stone of Zoheleth, which is by En-rogel, and invited all his brethren, the king's sons, and all the men of Judah, the king's servants;
<DT><A NAME="1:10">1:10</A><DD>but Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah, and the mighty men, and Solomon his brother, he did not invite.
<DT><A NAME="1:11">1:11</A><DD>And Nathan spoke to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon, saying, Hast thou not heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith is king, and David our lord does not know <I>it</I>?
<DT><A NAME="1:12">1:12</A><DD>And now, come, let me, I pray thee, give thee counsel, that thou mayest save thine own life, and the life of thy son Solomon.
<DT><A NAME="1:13">1:13</A><DD>Go and get thee in to king David, and say to him, Didst not thou, my lord, O king, swear to thy handmaid saying, Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne? why then does Adonijah reign?
<DT><A NAME="1:14">1:14</A><DD>Behold, while thou yet talkest there with the king, I also will come in after thee and <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1ki?n=1:14">confirm</A> thy words.
<DT><A NAME="1:15">1:15</A><DD>And Bathsheba went in to the king into the chamber; and the king was very old; and Abishag the Shunammite ministered to the king.
<DT><A NAME="1:16">1:16</A><DD>And Bathsheba bowed and did obeisance to the king. And the king said, What wouldest thou?
<DT><A NAME="1:17">1:17</A><DD>And she said to him, My lord, thou hast sworn by Jehovah thy God to thy handmaid, <I>saying,</I> Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne.
<DT><A NAME="1:18">1:18</A><DD>And now behold, Adonijah is king; and <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1ki?n=1:18">now</A>, my lord the king, thou knowest it not.
<DT><A NAME="1:19">1:19</A><DD>And he has sacrificed oxen and fatted cattle and sheep in abundance, and has invited all the sons of the king and Abiathar the priest and Joab the captain of the host; but Solomon thy servant has he not invited.
<DT><A NAME="1:20">1:20</A><DD>And thou, my lord the king, the eyes of all Israel are upon thee, that thou shouldest tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him.
<DT><A NAME="1:21">1:21</A><DD>Otherwise it shall come to pass when my lord the king shall <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1ki?n=1:21">sleep</A> with his fathers, that I and my son Solomon will be counted offenders.
<DT><A NAME="1:22">1:22</A><DD>And behold, while she yet talked with the king, Nathan the prophet also came in.
<DT><A NAME="1:23">1:23</A><DD>And they told the king saying, Behold, Nathan the prophet. And when he was come in before the king, he bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground.
<DT><A NAME="1:24">1:24</A><DD>And Nathan said, My lord, O king, hast thou said, Adonijah shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne?
<DT><A NAME="1:25">1:25</A><DD>For he is gone down this day, and has sacrificed oxen and fatted cattle and sheep in abundance, and has invited all the king's sons, and the captains of the host, and Abiathar the priest; and behold, they eat and drink before him, and say, God save king Adonijah!
<DT><A NAME="1:26">1:26</A><DD>But me, <I>even</I> me thy servant, and Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and thy servant Solomon, he has not invited.
<DT><A NAME="1:27">1:27</A><DD>Is this thing done by my lord the king, and thou hast not shewn to thy <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1ki?n=1:27">servants</A> who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him?
<DT><A NAME="1:28">1:28</A><DD>Then king David answered and said, Call me Bathsheba. And she came into the king's presence, and stood before the king.
<DT><A NAME="1:29">1:29</A><DD>And the king swore, and said, <I>As</I> Jehovah liveth, who has redeemed my soul out of all distress,
<DT><A NAME="1:30">1:30</A><DD>even as I swore to thee by Jehovah the God of Israel, saying, Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne in my stead; even so will I certainly do this day.
<DT><A NAME="1:31">1:31</A><DD>And Bathsheba bowed with her face to the earth, and did reverence to the king, and said, Let my lord king David live for ever.
<DT><A NAME="1:32">1:32</A><DD>And king David said, Call me Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada. And they came before the king.
<DT><A NAME="1:33">1:33</A><DD>And the king said to them, Take with you the servants of your lord, and cause Solomon my son to ride upon mine own mule, and bring him down to Gihon;
<DT><A NAME="1:34">1:34</A><DD>and let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him there king over Israel; and blow ye with the trumpet, and say, Long live king Solomon!
<DT><A NAME="1:35">1:35</A><DD>And ye shall come up after him, that he may come and sit on my throne; for he shall reign in my stead, and I have appointed him to be ruler over Israel and over Judah.
<DT><A NAME="1:36">1:36</A><DD>And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king and said, Amen: Jehovah, the God of my lord the king, say so too.
<DT><A NAME="1:37">1:37</A><DD>As Jehovah has been with my lord the king, even so be he with Solomon, and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord king David.
<DT><A NAME="1:38">1:38</A><DD>And Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites and the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1ki?n=1:38">Pelethites</A> went down, and caused Solomon to ride upon king David's mule, and brought him to Gihon.
<DT><A NAME="1:39">1:39</A><DD>And Zadok the priest took the horn of oil out of the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1ki?n=1:39">tabernacle</A>, and anointed Solomon. And they blew the trumpet; and all the people said, Long live king Solomon!
<DT><A NAME="1:40">1:40</A><DD>And all the people came up after him, and the people piped with pipes, and rejoiced with great joy, so that the earth rent with the sound of them.
<DT><A NAME="1:41">1:41</A><DD>And Adonijah and all the guests that were with him heard <I>it</I> as they were finishing their repast; and Joab heard the sound of the trumpet, and he said, Wherefore this noise of the city in an uproar?
<DT><A NAME="1:42">1:42</A><DD>While he yet spoke, behold, Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest came; and Adonijah said <I>to him</I>, Come in; for thou art a <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1ki?n=1:42">valiant</A> man, and bringest good news.
<DT><A NAME="1:43">1:43</A><DD>And Jonathan answered and said to Adonijah, Indeed, our lord king David has made Solomon king.
<DT><A NAME="1:44">1:44</A><DD>And the king has sent with him Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites, and they have caused him to ride upon the king's mule;
<DT><A NAME="1:45">1:45</A><DD>and Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king at Gihon; and they are come up from thence rejoicing, so that the city is in an uproar. This is the noise which ye have heard.
<DT><A NAME="1:46">1:46</A><DD>And also Solomon is sitting on the throne of the kingdom.
<DT><A NAME="1:47">1:47</A><DD>And moreover the king's servants came to bless our lord king David, saying, Thy God make the name of Solomon more excellent than thy name, and make his throne greater than thy throne! And the king bowed himself on the bed.
<DT><A NAME="1:48">1:48</A><DD>And also thus said the king: Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Israel, who has given one to sit on my throne this day, mine eyes even seeing it.
<DT><A NAME="1:49">1:49</A><DD>And all Adonijah's guests were afraid, and rose up and went every man his way.
<DT><A NAME="1:50">1:50</A><DD>And Adonijah feared because of Solomon, and arose and went and caught hold of the horns of the altar.
<DT><A NAME="1:51">1:51</A><DD>And it was told Solomon saying, Behold, Adonijah fears king Solomon; for behold, he has caught hold of the horns of the altar, saying, Let king Solomon swear to me this day that he will not put his servant to death with the sword.
<DT><A NAME="1:52">1:52</A><DD>And Solomon said, If he be a <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1ki?n=1:52">worthy</A> man, there shall not one of his hairs fall to the earth; but if wickedness be found in him, he shall die.
<DT><A NAME="1:53">1:53</A><DD>And king Solomon sent, and they brought him down from the altar. And he came and bowed himself to king Solomon; and Solomon said to him, Go to thy house.
</DL></DIV><H2>Chapter 2</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="2:1">2:1</A><DD>And the days of David were at hand that he should die; and he enjoined Solomon his son saying,
<DT><A NAME="2:2">2:2</A><DD>I go the way of all the earth: be of good courage therefore, and be a man;
<DT><A NAME="2:3">2:3</A><DD>and keep the charge of Jehovah thy God, to walk in his ways, to keep his statutes, and his commandments, and his ordinances, and his testimonies, as it is written in the law of Moses, that thou mayest <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1ki?n=2:3">prosper</A> in all that thou doest and whithersoever thou turnest thyself;
<DT><A NAME="2:4">2:4</A><DD>that Jehovah may confirm his word which he spoke concerning me, saying, If thy sons take heed to their way, to walk before me in truth with all their heart and with all their soul, there shall not fail <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1ki?n=2:4">thee</A>, said he, a man upon the throne of Israel.
<DT><A NAME="2:5">2:5</A><DD>And thou knowest also what Joab the son of Zeruiah did to me, what he did to the two captains of the hosts of Israel, to Abner the son of Ner, and to Amasa the son of Jether, whom he slew, and shed the blood of war in peace, and put the blood of war upon his girdle that was about his loins, and upon his sandals that were on his feet.
<DT><A NAME="2:6">2:6</A><DD>And thou shalt do according to thy wisdom, and not let his hoar head go down to <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1ki?n=2:6">Sheol</A> in peace.
<DT><A NAME="2:7">2:7</A><DD>But shew kindness to the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite, and let them be of those that eat at thy table; for so they came up to me when I fled because of Absalom thy brother.
<DT><A NAME="2:8">2:8</A><DD>And behold, there is with thee Shimei the son of Gera, the Benjaminite of Bahurim, who cursed me with a grievous curse in the day that I went to Mahanaim; but he came down to meet me at the Jordan, and I swore to him by Jehovah saying, I will not put thee to death with the sword.
<DT><A NAME="2:9">2:9</A><DD>And now hold him not guiltless; for thou art a wise man, and thou shalt know what thou oughtest to do to him; but bring his hoar head down to Sheol with blood.
<DT><A NAME="2:10">2:10</A><DD>And David slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David.
<DT><A NAME="2:11">2:11</A><DD>And the days that David reigned over Israel were forty years: he reigned seven years in Hebron, and he reigned thirty-three years in Jerusalem.
<DT><A NAME="2:12">2:12</A><DD>And Solomon sat on the throne of David his father; and his kingdom was established greatly.
<DT><A NAME="2:13">2:13</A><DD>And Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon. And she said, Comest thou peaceably? And he said, Peaceably.
<DT><A NAME="2:14">2:14</A><DD>And he said, I have something to say to thee. And she said, Speak.
<DT><A NAME="2:15">2:15</A><DD>And he said, Thou knowest that the kingdom was mine, and all Israel had set their faces on me that I should reign; but the kingdom is turned about and is become my brother's, for it was his from Jehovah.
<DT><A NAME="2:16">2:16</A><DD>And now I ask one petition of thee; refuse me <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1ki?n=2:16">not</A>. And she said to him, Speak.
<DT><A NAME="2:17">2:17</A><DD>And he said, Speak, I pray thee, to Solomon the king -- for he will not refuse thee -- that he give me Abishag the Shunammite as wife.
<DT><A NAME="2:18">2:18</A><DD>And Bathsheba said, Well, I will speak for thee to the king.
<DT><A NAME="2:19">2:19</A><DD>And Bathsheba went to king Solomon, to speak to him for Adonijah. And the king rose up to meet her, and bowed himself to her, and sat down on his throne; and he caused a throne to be set for the king's mother, and she sat on his right hand.
<DT><A NAME="2:20">2:20</A><DD>Then she said, I desire one small petition of thee; refuse me not. And the king said to her, Ask, my mother, for I will not refuse thee.
<DT><A NAME="2:21">2:21</A><DD>And she said, Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah thy brother as wife.
<DT><A NAME="2:22">2:22</A><DD>And king Solomon answered and said to his mother, And why dost thou ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? ask for him the kingdom also; for he is mine elder brother; even for him, and for Abiathar the priest, and for Joab the son of Zeruiah.
<DT><A NAME="2:23">2:23</A><DD>And king Solomon swore by Jehovah saying, God do so to me, and more also, -- Adonijah has spoken this word against his own life!
<DT><A NAME="2:24">2:24</A><DD>And now <I>as</I> Jehovah liveth, who has established me, and set me on the throne of David my father, and who has made me a house, as he promised, Adonijah shall be put to death this day.
<DT><A NAME="2:25">2:25</A><DD>And king Solomon sent by the hand of Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; who fell on him, that he died.
<DT><A NAME="2:26">2:26</A><DD>And the king said to Abiathar the priest, Go to Anathoth, to thine own fields; for thou art worthy of <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1ki?n=2:26">death</A>; but I will not at this time put thee to death, because thou didst bear the ark of <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1ki?n=2:26a">Adonai</A> Jehovah before David my father, and because thou hast been afflicted in all wherein my father was afflicted.
<DT><A NAME="2:27">2:27</A><DD>And Solomon thrust out Abiathar from being priest to Jehovah, to fulfil the word of Jehovah, which he had spoken concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh.
<DT><A NAME="2:28">2:28</A><DD>And the report came to Joab (for Joab had turned after Adonijah, though he had not turned after Absalom); and Joab fled to the tent of Jehovah, and caught hold of the horns of the altar.
<DT><A NAME="2:29">2:29</A><DD>And it was told king Solomon that Joab had fled to the tent of Jehovah; and behold, he is by the altar. And Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, saying, Go, fall on him.
<DT><A NAME="2:30">2:30</A><DD>And Benaiah came to the tent of Jehovah and said to him, Thus saith the king: Come forth. And he said, No; for I will die here. And Benaiah brought the king word again, saying, Thus said Joab, and thus he answered me.
<DT><A NAME="2:31">2:31</A><DD>And the king said to him, Do as he has said, and fall upon him, and bury him; and take away the innocent blood, which Joab shed, from me and from the house of my father.
<DT><A NAME="2:32">2:32</A><DD>And Jehovah shall requite the blood which he <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1ki?n=2:32">shed</A> upon his own head, because he fell upon two men more righteous and better than he, and slew them with the sword, without my father David's knowledge: Abner the son of Ner, captain of the host of Israel, and Amasa the son of Jether, captain of the host of Judah.
<DT><A NAME="2:33">2:33</A><DD>And their blood shall be requited upon the head of Joab, and upon the head of his seed for ever; but upon David, and upon his seed, and upon his house, and upon his throne, shall there be peace for ever from Jehovah.
<DT><A NAME="2:34">2:34</A><DD>And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up and fell upon him, and put him to death; and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness.
<DT><A NAME="2:35">2:35</A><DD>And the king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his stead over the host; and Zadok the priest the king put in the stead of Abiathar.
<DT><A NAME="2:36">2:36</A><DD>And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said to him, Build thee a house in Jerusalem, and abide there, and go not forth thence anywhere.
<DT><A NAME="2:37">2:37</A><DD>And it shall be that on the day thou goest forth, and passest over the torrent of Kidron, ... know for certain that thou shalt surely die: thy blood shall be upon thine own head.
<DT><A NAME="2:38">2:38</A><DD>And Shimei said to the king, The saying is good: as my lord the king has said, so will thy servant do. And Shimei dwelt in Jerusalem many days.
<DT><A NAME="2:39">2:39</A><DD>And it came to pass at the end of three years, that two servants of Shimei's ran away to Achish son of Maachah, king of Gath. And they told Shimei saying, Behold, thy servants are in Gath.
<DT><A NAME="2:40">2:40</A><DD>Then Shimei arose, and saddled his ass, and went to Gath, to Achish, to seek his servants; and Shimei went, and brought his servants from Gath.
<DT><A NAME="2:41">2:41</A><DD>And it was told Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath, and had come again.

<DT><A NAME="7:9">7:9</A><DD>All these <I>buildings</I> were of costly stones, hewn stones, according to the measures, sawed with saws, within and without, even from the foundation to the coping, and on the outside as far as the great court.
<DT><A NAME="7:10">7:10</A><DD>And the foundations were of costly stones, great stones, stones of ten cubits and stones of eight cubits.
<DT><A NAME="7:11">7:11</A><DD>And above were costly stones, hewn stones, according to the measures, and cedar.
<DT><A NAME="7:12">7:12</A><DD>And the great court round about had three rows of hewn stones, and a row of cedar-beams; and so it was for the inner court of the house of Jehovah, and the porch of the house.
<DT><A NAME="7:13">7:13</A><DD>And king Solomon sent and fetched Hiram out of Tyre.
<DT><A NAME="7:14">7:14</A><DD>He was a widow's son of the tribe of <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1ki?n=7:14">Naphtali</A>, and his father was a man of Tyre, a worker in <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1ki?n=7:14a">brass</A>; and he was full of <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1ki?n=7:14b">wisdom</A> and understanding and knowledge, to do all kinds of works in brass. And he came to king Solomon, and made all his work.
<DT><A NAME="7:15">7:15</A><DD>And he formed the two pillars of brass; the height of one pillar was eighteen cubits, and a line of twelve cubits encompassed the second pillar.
<DT><A NAME="7:16">7:16</A><DD>And he made two capitals of molten brass, to set upon the tops of the pillars; the height of the one capital was five cubits, and the height of the other capital was five cubits;
<DT><A NAME="7:17">7:17</A><DD><I>and</I> nets of checker-work, wreaths of chain-work, for the capitals which were upon the top of the pillars; seven for the one capital and seven for the other capital.
<DT><A NAME="7:18">7:18</A><DD>And he made pomegranates, namely two rows round about upon the one network, to cover the capitals that were upon the top of the pillars; and so he did for the other capital.
<DT><A NAME="7:19">7:19</A><DD>And the capitals that were upon the top of the pillars were of lily-work <I>as</I> in the porch, four cubits.
<DT><A NAME="7:20">7:20</A><DD>And the capitals upon the two pillars, above also, close to the enlargement which was <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1ki?n=7:20">behind</A> the network, had two hundred pomegranates in rows round about, <I>also</I> on the other capital.
<DT><A NAME="7:21">7:21</A><DD>And he set up the pillars <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1ki?n=7:21">for</A> the porch of the temple; and he set up the right pillar, and called its name <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1ki?n=7:21a">Jachin</A>; and he set up the left pillar, and called its name <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1ki?n=7:21b">Boaz</A>.
<DT><A NAME="7:22">7:22</A><DD>And upon the top of the pillars was lily-work; and the work of the pillars was finished.
<DT><A NAME="7:23">7:23</A><DD>And he made the sea, molten, ten cubits from brim to <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1ki?n=7:23">brim</A>, round all about; and its height was five cubits; and a line of thirty cubits encompassed it round about.
<DT><A NAME="7:24">7:24</A><DD>And under the brim of it round about there were colocynths, encompassing it, ten in a cubit enclosing the sea round about; two rows of colocynths, cast when it was cast.
<DT><A NAME="7:25">7:25</A><DD>It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east; and the sea was above upon them, and all their hinder parts were inward.
<DT><A NAME="7:26">7:26</A><DD>And its thickness was a hand-breadth, and its brim was like the work of the brim of a cup, with lily-blossoms; it held two thousand <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1ki?n=7:26">baths</A>.
<DT><A NAME="7:27">7:27</A><DD>And he made ten bases of brass: four cubits was the length of one base, and the breadth four cubits, and the height three cubits.
<DT><A NAME="7:28">7:28</A><DD>And the work of the bases was this: they had panels, and the panels were between the fillets.
<DT><A NAME="7:29">7:29</A><DD>And on the panels that were between the fillets were lions, oxen and cherubim; and over the fillets there was a base above; and beneath the lions and oxen were garlands of festoon-work.
<DT><A NAME="7:30">7:30</A><DD>And every base had four wheels of brass, and axles of brass; and on its four corners were shoulder-pieces: under the laver were shoulder-pieces molten, behind every garland.
<DT><A NAME="7:31">7:31</A><DD>And the mouth of it within the crown and above was a cubit; and its mouth was rounded, <I>as</I> the work of the base, a cubit and a half; and also upon its mouth was sculpture; but their panels were square, not round.
<DT><A NAME="7:32">7:32</A><DD>And the four wheels were under the panels; and the supports of the wheels were in the base; and the height of a wheel was a cubit and half a cubit.
<DT><A NAME="7:33">7:33</A><DD>And the work of the wheels was like the work of a chariot wheel: their supports, and their rims, and their spokes and their naves were all molten.
<DT><A NAME="7:34">7:34</A><DD>And there were four shoulder-pieces to the four corners of one base; of the base itself were its shoulder-pieces.
<DT><A NAME="7:35">7:35</A><DD>And in the top of the base there was a circular elevation of half a cubit round about; and on the top of the base its stays and its panels were of the same.
<DT><A NAME="7:36">7:36</A><DD>And he engraved on the plates of its stays and on its panels cherubim, lions and palm-trees, according to the space upon each; and garlands were round about.
<DT><A NAME="7:37">7:37</A><DD>After this <I>manner</I> he made the ten bases: all of them had one casting, one measure, one form.
<DT><A NAME="7:38">7:38</A><DD>And he made ten lavers of brass: one laver contained forty baths; every laver was four cubits; upon every one of the ten bases one laver.
<DT><A NAME="7:39">7:39</A><DD>And he put the bases, five on the right <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1ki?n=7:39">side</A> of the house, and five on the left side of the house; and he set the sea on the right <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1ki?n=7:39">side</A> of the house eastward, over against the south.
<DT><A NAME="7:40">7:40</A><DD>And Hiram made the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1ki?n=7:40">lavers</A>, and the shovels, and the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1ki?n=7:40a">bowls</A>. So Hiram ended doing all the work that he made for king Solomon <I>for</I> the house of Jehovah:
<DT><A NAME="7:41">7:41</A><DD>two pillars, and the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1ki?n=7:41">globes</A> of the capitals that were on the top of the pillars, two; and the two networks, to cover the two globes of the capitals which were on the top of the pillars;
<DT><A NAME="7:42">7:42</A><DD>and the four hundred pomegranates for the two networks, two rows of pomegranates for one network, to cover the two globes of the capitals which were upon the pillars;
<DT><A NAME="7:43">7:43</A><DD>and the ten bases, and the ten lavers on the bases;
<DT><A NAME="7:44">7:44</A><DD>and one sea, and the twelve oxen under the sea;
<DT><A NAME="7:45">7:45</A><DD>and the pots, and the shovels, and the bowls. And all these <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1ki?n=7:45">things</A>, which Hiram made king Solomon for the house of Jehovah, were of bright brass.
<DT><A NAME="7:46">7:46</A><DD>In the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1ki?n=7:46">plain</A> of the Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay-ground between Succoth and Zaretan.
<DT><A NAME="7:47">7:47</A><DD>And Solomon left all the vessels <I>unweighed</I> from their exceeding number; the weight of the brass was not ascertained.
<DT><A NAME="7:48">7:48</A><DD>And Solomon made all the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1ki?n=7:45">vessels</A> that were <I>in</I> the house of Jehovah: the golden altar; and the table of gold, whereon was the shewbread;
<DT><A NAME="7:49">7:49</A><DD>and the candlesticks of pure gold, five on the right, and five on the left, before the oracle; and the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs of gold,
<DT><A NAME="7:50">7:50</A><DD>and the basons, and the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1ki?n=7:50">knives</A>, and the bowls, and the cups, and the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1ki?n=7:50a">censers</A> of pure gold; and the hinges of gold, for the folding-doors of the inner house, the most holy place, <I>and</I> for the doors of the house, of the temple.
<DT><A NAME="7:51">7:51</A><DD>And all the work was finished that king Solomon made for the house of Jehovah. And Solomon brought in the things that David his father had dedicated; the silver and the gold and the vessels he put among the treasures of the house of Jehovah.
</DL></DIV><H2>Chapter 8</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="8:1">8:1</A><DD>Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, the princes of the fathers of the children of Israel, unto king Solomon in Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of Jehovah out of the city of David, which is Zion.
<DT><A NAME="8:2">8:2</A><DD>And all the men of Israel assembled themselves to king Solomon at the feast in the month <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1ki?n=8:2">Ethanim</A>, that is, the seventh month.
<DT><A NAME="8:3">8:3</A><DD>And all the elders of Israel came; and the priests took up the ark.
<DT><A NAME="8:4">8:4</A><DD>And they brought up the ark of Jehovah, and the tent of meeting, and all the holy vessels that were in the tent: the priests and the Levites brought them up.
<DT><A NAME="8:5">8:5</A><DD>And king Solomon, and all the assembly of Israel that were assembled to him, <I>who were</I> with him before the ark, sacrificed sheep and oxen, which could not be counted nor numbered for multitude.
<DT><A NAME="8:6">8:6</A><DD>And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of Jehovah to its place, into the oracle of the house, into the most holy place, under the wings of the cherubim;
<DT><A NAME="8:7">8:7</A><DD>for the cherubim stretched forth <I>their</I> wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubim covered the ark and its staves above.
<DT><A NAME="8:8">8:8</A><DD>And the staves were <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1ki?n=8:8">long</A>, so that the ends of the staves were seen from the holy place before the oracle, but they were not seen without. And there they are to this day.
<DT><A NAME="8:9">8:9</A><DD>There was nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone which Moses placed there at Horeb, when Jehovah made <I>a covenant</I> <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1ki?n=8:9">with</A> the children of Israel, when they came out of the land of Egypt.
<DT><A NAME="8:10">8:10</A><DD>And it came to pass when the priests were come out of the holy place, that the cloud filled the house of Jehovah,
<DT><A NAME="8:11">8:11</A><DD>and the priests could not stand to do their service because of the cloud; for the glory of Jehovah had filled the house of Jehovah.
<DT><A NAME="8:12">8:12</A><DD>Then said Solomon: Jehovah said that he would dwell in the thick darkness.
<DT><A NAME="8:13">8:13</A><DD>I have indeed built a house of habitation for thee, a settled <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1ki?n=8:13">place</A> for thee to abide in for ever.
<DT><A NAME="8:14">8:14</A><DD>And the king turned his face, and blessed the whole congregation of Israel; and the whole congregation of Israel stood.
<DT><A NAME="8:15">8:15</A><DD>And he said: Blessed be Jehovah the God of Israel, who spoke with his mouth unto David my father, and hath with his hand fulfilled it, saying,
<DT><A NAME="8:16">8:16</A><DD>Since the day that I brought forth my people Israel out of Egypt, I chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel to build a house in, that my name might be there; but I have chosen David to be over my people Israel.
<DT><A NAME="8:17">8:17</A><DD>And it was in the heart of David my father to build a house unto the name of Jehovah the God of Israel.
<DT><A NAME="8:18">8:18</A><DD>But Jehovah said to David my father, Whereas it was in thy heart to build a house unto my name, thou didst well that it was in thy heart;
<DT><A NAME="8:19">8:19</A><DD>nevertheless thou shalt not build the house; but thy son that shall come forth out of thy loins, he shall build the house unto my name.
<DT><A NAME="8:20">8:20</A><DD>And Jehovah has performed his word which he spoke; and I am risen up in the room of David my father, and sit on the throne of Israel, as Jehovah promised, and I have built the house unto the name of Jehovah the God of Israel.
<DT><A NAME="8:21">8:21</A><DD>And I have set there a place for the ark, wherein is the covenant of Jehovah, which he made with our fathers when he brought them out of the land of Egypt.
<DT><A NAME="8:22">8:22</A><DD>And Solomon stood before the altar of Jehovah in the presence of the whole congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands toward the heavens.
<DT><A NAME="8:23">8:23</A><DD>And he said, Jehovah, God of Israel! there is no God like thee, in the heavens above, or on the earth beneath, who keepest covenant and mercy with thy servants that walk before thee with all their heart;

<DT><A NAME="8:26">8:26</A><DD>And now, O God of Israel, let thy words, I pray thee, be verified, which thou hast spoken unto thy servant David my father.

<DT><A NAME="8:30">8:30</A><DD>And hearken unto the supplication of thy servant, and of thy people Israel, when they shall pray toward this place, and hear thou in thy dwelling-place, in the heavens, and when thou hearest, forgive.
<DT><A NAME="8:31">8:31</A><DD>If a man have sinned against his neighbour, and an oath be laid upon him to adjure him, and the oath come before thine altar in this house;

<DT><A NAME="8:33">8:33</A><DD>When thy people Israel are put to the worse before the enemy, because they have sinned against thee, and shall turn again to thee, and confess thy name, and pray, and make supplication unto thee in this house;

<DT><A NAME="8:63">8:63</A><DD>And Solomon sacrificed a sacrifice of peace-offerings, which he sacrificed to Jehovah, twenty-two thousand oxen and a hundred and twenty thousand sheep. So the king and all the children of Israel dedicated the house of Jehovah.
<DT><A NAME="8:64">8:64</A><DD>The same day the king hallowed the middle of the court that was before the house of Jehovah; for there he offered the burnt-offerings, and the oblations, and the fat of the peace-offerings, because the brazen altar that was before Jehovah was too small to receive the burnt-offerings, and the oblations, and the fat of the peace-offerings.
<DT><A NAME="8:65">8:65</A><DD>And at that time Solomon held the feast, and all Israel with him, a great congregation, from the entrance of Hamath unto the torrent of Egypt, before Jehovah our God, seven days and seven days, fourteen days.
<DT><A NAME="8:66">8:66</A><DD>On the eighth day he sent the people away; and they blessed the king, and went to their tents, joyful and glad of heart for all the goodness that Jehovah had done to David his servant, and to Israel his people.

<DT><A NAME="9:16">9:16</A><DD>-- Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up and taken Gezer, and burned it with fire, and slain the Canaanites that dwelt in the city, and given it as a dowry to his daughter, Solomon's wife.
<DT><A NAME="9:17">9:17</A><DD>-- And Solomon built Gezer, and lower Beth-horon,

<DT><A NAME="9:22">9:22</A><DD>But of the children of Israel did Solomon make no bondmen; but they were men of war, and his servants, and his chiefs, and his captains, and captains of his chariots, and his horsemen.
<DT><A NAME="9:23">9:23</A><DD>These were the chief superintendents that were over Solomon's work, five hundred and fifty, that ruled over the people that wrought in the work.

<DT><A NAME="11:3">11:3</A><DD>And he had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred concubines; and his wives turned away his heart.
<DT><A NAME="11:4">11:4</A><DD>And it came to pass when Solomon was old, <I>that</I> his wives turned away his heart after other gods; and his heart was not perfect with Jehovah his God, as the heart of David his father.
<DT><A NAME="11:5">11:5</A><DD>And Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, and after Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites.
<DT><A NAME="11:6">11:6</A><DD>And Solomon did evil in the sight of Jehovah, and followed not fully Jehovah, as David his father.
<DT><A NAME="11:7">11:7</A><DD>Then did Solomon build a high place for Chemosh the abomination of the Moabites, on the hill that is before Jerusalem, and for Molech the abomination of the children of Ammon.

<DT><A NAME="11:9">11:9</A><DD>And Jehovah was angry with Solomon, because his heart was turned away from Jehovah the God of Israel, who had appeared to him twice,

<DT><A NAME="11:18">11:18</A><DD>And they arose out of Midian, and came to Paran, and took men with them out of Paran, and they came to Egypt, to Pharaoh king of Egypt; who gave him a house, and appointed him victuals, and gave him land.
<DT><A NAME="11:19">11:19</A><DD>And Hadad found great favour in the sight of Pharaoh, and he gave him as wife the sister of his own wife, the sister of Tahpenes the queen.
<DT><A NAME="11:20">11:20</A><DD>And the sister of Tahpenes bore him Genubath his son; and Tahpenes brought him up in Pharaoh's house; and Genubath was in Pharaoh's household, among the sons of Pharaoh.
<DT><A NAME="11:21">11:21</A><DD>And Hadad heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers, and that Joab the captain of the host was dead; and Hadad said to Pharaoh, Let me depart, that I may go to mine own country.
<DT><A NAME="11:22">11:22</A><DD>And Pharaoh said to him, What then dost thou lack with me, that behold, thou desirest to go to thine own country? And he said, Nothing; but in any case let me depart.
<DT><A NAME="11:23">11:23</A><DD>God stirred him up yet an adversary, Rezon the son of Eliada, who had fled from Hadadezer king of Zobah, his lord.

<DT><A NAME="11:25">11:25</A><DD>And he was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon, besides the mischief that Hadad <I>did</I>; and he abhorred Israel, and reigned over Syria.

<DT><A NAME="11:28">11:28</A><DD>and the man Jeroboam was strong and valiant; and Solomon saw the young man that he was industrious, and he made him ruler over all the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1ki?n=11:28">charge</A> of the house of Joseph.
<DT><A NAME="11:29">11:29</A><DD>And it came to pass at that time that Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem, and the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found him in the way; and he had clad himself with a new garment; and they two were alone in the field.

<DT><A NAME="11:32">11:32</A><DD>but one tribe shall he have for my servant David's sake, and for Jerusalem's sake, the city which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel:
<DT><A NAME="11:33">11:33</A><DD>because they have forsaken me, and have worshipped Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, Chemosh the god of the Moabites, and Milcom the god of the children of Ammon, and have not walked in my ways, to do that which is right in my sight, and my statutes and mine ordinances, as David his father.
<DT><A NAME="11:34">11:34</A><DD>But I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand; for I will make him prince all the days of his life for David my servant's sake, whom I chose, who kept my commandments and my statutes;
<DT><A NAME="11:35">11:35</A><DD>but I will take the kingdom out of his son's hand, and will give it unto thee, -- the ten tribes.
<DT><A NAME="11:36">11:36</A><DD>And unto his son will I give one tribe, that David my servant may have a lamp always before me in Jerusalem, the city that I have chosen for myself to put my name there.
<DT><A NAME="11:37">11:37</A><DD>And I will take thee, that thou mayest reign over all that thy soul desireth, and thou shalt be king over Israel.
<DT><A NAME="11:38">11:38</A><DD>And it shall be, if thou wilt hearken unto all that I command thee, and wilt walk in my ways, and do that which is right in my sight, in keeping my statutes and my commandments, as David my servant did, that I will be with thee, and build thee a lasting house, as I built for David, and will give Israel unto thee.

<DT><A NAME="12:9">12:9</A><DD>And he said to them, What advice give ye that we may return answer to this people who have spoken to me saying, Lighten the yoke which thy father put upon us?
<DT><A NAME="12:10">12:10</A><DD>And the young men that had grown up with him spoke to him saying, Thus shalt thou say to this people that have spoken to thee saying, Thy father made our yoke heavy, and lighten thou it for us, -- thus shalt thou say to them: My little <I>finger</I> is thicker than my father's loins;

<DT><A NAME="12:12">12:12</A><DD>And Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as the king had appointed saying, Come again to me on the third day.

<DT><A NAME="13:17">13:17</A><DD>For it was said to me by the word of Jehovah, Thou shalt eat no bread nor drink water there, nor turn again to go by the way that thou wentest.
<DT><A NAME="13:18">13:18</A><DD>And he said to him, I am a prophet also as thou art; and an angel spoke to me by the word of Jehovah saying, Bring him back with thee into thy house, that he may eat bread and drink water. He lied unto him.
<DT><A NAME="13:19">13:19</A><DD>Then he went back with him, and ate bread in his house, and drank water.
<DT><A NAME="13:20">13:20</A><DD>And it came to pass as they sat at the table, that the word of Jehovah came to the prophet that brought him back;

<DT><A NAME="13:22">13:22</A><DD>but camest back, and hast eaten bread and drunk water in the place of which he said to thee, Eat no bread and drink no water; thy carcase shall not come to the sepulchre of thy fathers.
<DT><A NAME="13:23">13:23</A><DD>And it came to pass, after he had eaten bread, and after he had drunk, that he saddled the ass for him, for the prophet that he had brought back;

<DT><A NAME="13:25">13:25</A><DD>And behold, men passed by, and saw the corpse cast in the way and the lion standing by the corpse; and they came and told it in the city where the old prophet dwelt.
<DT><A NAME="13:26">13:26</A><DD>And the prophet that brought him back from the way heard <I>of it</I> and said, It is the man of God who was disobedient to the word of Jehovah; therefore Jehovah has delivered him to the lion, which has torn him and slain him, according to the word of Jehovah which he spoke to him.
<DT><A NAME="13:27">13:27</A><DD>And he spoke to his sons saying, Saddle me the ass; and they saddled it.
<DT><A NAME="13:28">13:28</A><DD>And he went and found his corpse cast in the way, and the ass and the lion standing by the corpse: the lion had not eaten the corpse, nor torn the ass.

<DT><A NAME="13:31">13:31</A><DD>And it came to pass after he had buried him, that he spoke to his sons saying, When I am dead, bury me in the sepulchre in which the man of God is buried; lay my bones beside his bones.
<DT><A NAME="13:32">13:32</A><DD>For the word that he cried by the word of Jehovah against the altar in Bethel, and against all the houses of the high places that are in the cities of Samaria, shall certainly come to pass.
<DT><A NAME="13:33">13:33</A><DD>After this thing Jeroboam turned not from his evil way, but made again from all <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1ki?n=13:33">classes</A> of the people priests of the high places: whosoever would, he consecrated him, and he became <I>one</I> of the priests of the high places.

<DT><A NAME="20:29">20:29</A><DD>And they encamped one over against the other seven days; and it came to pass that on the seventh day the battle was joined; and the children of Israel smote of the Syrians a hundred thousand footmen in one day.
<DT><A NAME="20:30">20:30</A><DD>And the rest fled to Aphek, into the city; and the wall fell on twenty-seven thousand men of them that were left. And Ben-Hadad fled, and came into the city, <I>from</I> chamber to <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1ki?n=20:30">chamber</A>.
<DT><A NAME="20:31">20:31</A><DD>And his servants said to him, Behold now, we have heard that the kings of the house of Israel are merciful kings: let us, I pray thee, put sackcloth on our loins, and ropes upon our heads, and go out to the king of Israel; perhaps he will save thy life.
<DT><A NAME="20:32">20:32</A><DD>And they girded sackcloth on their loins, and ropes on their heads, and came to the king of Israel, and said, Thy servant Ben-Hadad says, I pray thee, let me live. And he said, Is he yet alive? he is my brother.
<DT><A NAME="20:33">20:33</A><DD>And the men took it as a good <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1ki?n=20:33">omen</A>, and hastened to catch what came from him, and they said, Thy brother Ben-Hadad. ...

<DT><A NAME="20:38">20:38</A><DD>And the prophet departed, and waited for the king by the way, and disguised himself with a sash over his eyes.
<DT><A NAME="20:39">20:39</A><DD>And as the king passed by, he cried to the king and said, Thy servant went out into the midst of the battle; and behold, a man turned aside, and brought a man to me and said, Keep this man; if by any means he be missing, then shall thy life be for his life, or thou shalt <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1ki?n=20:39">pay</A> a talent of silver.
<DT><A NAME="20:40">20:40</A><DD>And as thy servant was busy here and there, he was gone. And the king of Israel said to him, So <I>is</I> thy judgment: thyself hast decided <I>it</I>.
<DT><A NAME="20:41">20:41</A><DD>Then he hastily took the sash away from his face; and the king of Israel discerned him, that he was of the prophets.

<DT><A NAME="21:1">21:1</A><DD>And it came to pass after these things, <I>that</I> Naboth the Jizreelite had a vineyard, which was in Jizreel, by the side of the palace of Ahab king of Samaria.
<DT><A NAME="21:2">21:2</A><DD>And Ahab spoke to Naboth saying, Give me thy vineyard, that I may have it for a garden of herbs, for it is near, by the side of my house; and I will give thee for it a better vineyard than it; if it seem good to thee, I will give thee its value in money.
<DT><A NAME="21:3">21:3</A><DD>And Naboth said to Ahab, Jehovah forbid it me, that I should give the inheritance of my fathers to thee!
<DT><A NAME="21:4">21:4</A><DD>And Ahab came into his house sullen and vexed because of the word that Naboth the Jizreelite had spoken to him; for he had said, I will not give thee the inheritance of my fathers. And he lay down on his bed, and turned away his face, and ate no bread.
<DT><A NAME="21:5">21:5</A><DD>And Jezebel his wife came to him, and said to him, Why is thy spirit sullen, and thou eatest no bread?
<DT><A NAME="21:6">21:6</A><DD>And he said to her, Because I spoke to Naboth the Jizreelite and said to him, Give me thy vineyard for money; or else, if it please thee, I will give thee a vineyard for it; and he said, I will not give thee my vineyard.
<DT><A NAME="21:7">21:7</A><DD>And Jezebel his wife said to him, Dost thou now exercise sovereignty over Israel? arise, eat bread, and let thy heart be glad: I will give thee the vineyard of Naboth the Jizreelite.
<DT><A NAME="21:8">21:8</A><DD>And she wrote a letter in Ahab's name, and sealed it with his seal, and sent the letter to the elders and to the nobles that were in his city, dwelling with Naboth.
<DT><A NAME="21:9">21:9</A><DD>And she wrote in the letter saying, Proclaim a fast, and <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1ki?n=21:9">set</A> Naboth at the head of the people;
<DT><A NAME="21:10">21:10</A><DD>and <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1ki?n=21:9">set</A> two men, sons of Belial, before him, and they shall bear witness against him saying, Thou didst curse God and the king; and carry him out, and stone him, that he may die.
<DT><A NAME="21:11">21:11</A><DD>And the men of his city, the elders and the nobles that dwelt in his city, did as Jezebel had sent to them, as it was written in the letter that she had sent to them:
<DT><A NAME="21:12">21:12</A><DD>they proclaimed a fast, and set Naboth at the head of the people.
<DT><A NAME="21:13">21:13</A><DD>And there came the two men, sons of Belial, and sat before him; and the men of Belial witnessed against him, against Naboth, in the presence of the people, saying, Naboth blasphemed God and the king. And they carried him forth out of the city, and stoned him with stones, that he died.
<DT><A NAME="21:14">21:14</A><DD>And they sent to Jezebel saying, Naboth is stoned, and is dead.
<DT><A NAME="21:15">21:15</A><DD>And it came to pass when Jezebel heard that Naboth was stoned and was dead, that Jezebel said to Ahab, Arise, take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jizreelite, which he refused to give thee for money; for Naboth is not alive, but dead.
<DT><A NAME="21:16">21:16</A><DD>And it came to pass when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, that Ahab rose up to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jizreelite, to take possession of it.
<DT><A NAME="21:17">21:17</A><DD>And the word of Jehovah came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,
<DT><A NAME="21:18">21:18</A><DD>Arise, go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, who is in Samaria: behold, he is in the vineyard of Naboth, whither he is gone down to take possession of it.
<DT><A NAME="21:19">21:19</A><DD>And thou shalt speak unto him saying, Thus saith Jehovah: Hast thou killed, and also taken possession? And thou shalt speak unto him saying, Thus saith Jehovah: In the place where the dogs licked the blood of Naboth shall the dogs lick thy blood, even thine.
<DT><A NAME="21:20">21:20</A><DD>And Ahab said to Elijah, Hast thou found me, mine enemy? And he said, I have found <I>thee</I>; because thou hast sold thyself to do evil in the sight of Jehovah.
<DT><A NAME="21:21">21:21</A><DD>Behold, I will bring evil upon thee, and will take away thy posterity, and will cut off from Ahab every male, and him that is shut up and left in Israel;
<DT><A NAME="21:22">21:22</A><DD>and I will make thy house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah, for the provocation wherewith thou hast provoked me to anger, and made Israel to sin.
<DT><A NAME="21:23">21:23</A><DD>And of Jezebel also spoke Jehovah saying, The dogs shall eat Jezebel by the moat of Jizreel.
<DT><A NAME="21:24">21:24</A><DD>Him that dieth of Ahab in the city shall the dogs eat, and him that dieth in the field shall the fowl of the heavens eat.
<DT><A NAME="21:25">21:25</A><DD>(Surely there was none like to Ahab, who did sell himself to do evil in the sight of Jehovah, Jezebel his wife urging him on.
<DT><A NAME="21:26">21:26</A><DD>And he did very abominably in following <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1ki?n=21:26">idols</A>, according to all that the Amorites did, whom Jehovah had dispossessed before the children of Israel.)
<DT><A NAME="21:27">21:27</A><DD>And it came to pass when Ahab heard these words, that he rent his garments, and put sackcloth upon his flesh, and fasted, and lay in sackcloth, and went softly.
<DT><A NAME="21:28">21:28</A><DD>And the word of Jehovah came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,
<DT><A NAME="21:29">21:29</A><DD>Seest thou how Ahab humbleth himself before me? because he humbleth himself before me, I will not bring the evil in his days: in his son's days will I bring the evil upon his house.

<DT><A NAME="22:3">22:3</A><DD>And the king of Israel said to his servants, Do ye know that Ramoth in Gilead is ours, and we keep quiet without taking it out of the hand of the king of Syria?
<DT><A NAME="22:4">22:4</A><DD>And he said to Jehoshaphat, Wilt thou go with me to battle to Ramoth-Gilead? And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, I am as thou, my people as thy people, my horses as thy horses.
<DT><A NAME="22:5">22:5</A><DD>And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, Inquire, I pray thee, this <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1ki?n=22:5">day</A> of the word of Jehovah.
<DT><A NAME="22:6">22:6</A><DD>And the king of Israel assembled the prophets, about four hundred men, and said to them, Shall I go against Ramoth-Gilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up, and the Lord will give it into the king's hand.
<DT><A NAME="22:7">22:7</A><DD>But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of Jehovah besides, that we might inquire of him?
<DT><A NAME="22:8">22:8</A><DD>And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, There is yet one man by whom we may inquire of Jehovah; but I hate him, for he prophesies no good concerning me, but evil: <I>it is</I> <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1ki?n=22:8">Micah</A> the son of Imlah. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king say so.
<DT><A NAME="22:9">22:9</A><DD>Then the king of Israel called a <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1ki?n=22:9">chamberlain</A>, and said, Fetch quickly Micah the son of Imlah.

<DT><A NAME="22:13">22:13</A><DD>And the messenger that went to call Micah spoke to him saying, Behold now, the words of the prophets <I>declare</I> good to the king with one assent: let thy word, I pray thee, be like the word of one of them, and speak good.
<DT><A NAME="22:14">22:14</A><DD>And Micah said, As Jehovah liveth, even what Jehovah shall say to me, that will I speak.
<DT><A NAME="22:15">22:15</A><DD>And he came to the king. And the king said to him, Micah, shall we go against Ramoth-Gilead to battle, or shall we forbear? And he said to him, Go up, and prosper; for Jehovah will give it into the hand of the king.
<DT><A NAME="22:16">22:16</A><DD>And the king said to him, How many times shall I adjure thee that thou tell me nothing but truth in the name of Jehovah?
<DT><A NAME="22:17">22:17</A><DD>And he said, I saw all Israel scattered upon the mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd. And Jehovah said, These have no master: let them return every man to his house in peace.
<DT><A NAME="22:18">22:18</A><DD>And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell thee that he prophesies no good concerning me, but evil?
<DT><A NAME="22:19">22:19</A><DD>And he said, Hear therefore the word of Jehovah: I saw Jehovah sitting upon his throne, and all the host of heaven standing by him, on his right hand and on his left;
<DT><A NAME="22:20">22:20</A><DD>and Jehovah said, Who shall entice Ahab that he may go up and fall at Ramoth-Gilead? And one said after this manner, and another said after that manner.
