<DT><A NAME="1:1">1:1</A><DD>Paul, <I>a</I> called apostle of Jesus Christ, by God's will, and Sosthenes the brother,
<DT><A NAME="1:2">1:2</A><DD>to the assembly of God which is in Corinth, to <I>those</I> sanctified in Christ Jesus, called <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1co?n=1:2">saints</A>, with all that in every place call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, both theirs and ours:
<DT><A NAME="1:3">1:3</A><DD>Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and <I>the</I> Lord Jesus Christ.
<DT><A NAME="1:4">1:4</A><DD>I thank my God always about you, <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1co?n=1:4">in respect of</A> the grace of God given to you in Christ Jesus;
<DT><A NAME="1:5">1:5</A><DD>that in everything ye have been enriched in him, in all <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1co?n=1:5">word</A> <I>of doctrine</I>, and all knowledge,
<DT><A NAME="1:6">1:6</A><DD>(according as the testimony of the Christ has been confirmed in you,)
<DT><A NAME="1:7">1:7</A><DD>so that ye come short in no gift, <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1co?n=1:7">awaiting</A> the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ;
<DT><A NAME="1:8">1:8</A><DD>who shall also confirm you to <I>the</I> end, unimpeachable in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.
<DT><A NAME="1:9">1:9</A><DD>God <I>is</I> faithful, by whom ye have been called into <I>the</I> <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1co?n=1:9">fellowship</A> of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord.
<DT><A NAME="1:10">1:10</A><DD>Now I <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1co?n=1:10">exhort</A> you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all say the same thing, and that there be not among you divisions; but that ye be perfectly <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1co?n=1:10a">united</A> in the same mind and in the same opinion.
<DT><A NAME="1:11">1:11</A><DD>For it has been shewn to me concerning you, my brethren, by those of <I>the house of</I> Chloe, that there are strifes among you.
<DT><A NAME="1:12">1:12</A><DD>But I speak of this, that each of you says, *I* am of Paul, and *I* of Apollos, and *I* of Cephas, and *I* of Christ.
<DT><A NAME="1:13">1:13</A><DD>Is the Christ divided? has Paul been crucified for you? or have ye been baptised unto the name of Paul?
<DT><A NAME="1:14">1:14</A><DD>I thank God that I have baptised none of you, unless Crispus and Gaius,
<DT><A NAME="1:15">1:15</A><DD>that no one may say that I have baptised unto my own name.
<DT><A NAME="1:16">1:16</A><DD>Yes, I baptised also the house of Stephanas; for the rest I know not if I have baptised any other.
<DT><A NAME="1:17">1:17</A><DD>For Christ has not sent me to baptise, but to preach glad tidings; not in wisdom of word, that the cross of the Christ may not be made vain.
<DT><A NAME="1:18">1:18</A><DD>For the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1co?n=1:18">word</A> of the cross is to them that perish foolishness, but to us that are saved it is God's power.
<DT><A NAME="1:19">1:19</A><DD>For it is <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1co?n=1:19">written</A>, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and set aside the understanding of the understanding ones.
<DT><A NAME="1:20">1:20</A><DD>Where <I>is the</I> wise? where scribe? where disputer of this <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1co?n=1:20">world</A>? has not God made foolish the wisdom of the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1co?n=1:20a">world</A>?
<DT><A NAME="1:21">1:21</A><DD>For since, in the wisdom of God, the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1co?n=1:20a">world</A> by wisdom has not known God, God has been pleased by the foolishness of the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1co?n=1:21">preaching</A> to save those that believe.
<DT><A NAME="1:22">1:22</A><DD>Since Jews indeed ask for signs, and Greeks seek wisdom;
<DT><A NAME="1:23">1:23</A><DD>but *we* preach Christ crucified, to Jews an <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1co?n=1:23">offence</A>, and to nations foolishness;
<DT><A NAME="1:24">1:24</A><DD>but to those that <I>are</I> called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ God's power and God's wisdom.
<DT><A NAME="1:25">1:25</A><DD>Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men.
<DT><A NAME="1:26">1:26</A><DD>For consider your calling, brethren, that <I>there are</I> not many wise according to flesh, not many powerful, not many high-born.
<DT><A NAME="1:27">1:27</A><DD>But God has chosen the foolish things of the world, that he may put to shame the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1co?n=1:27">wise</A>; and God has chosen the weak things of the world, that he may put to shame the strong things;
<DT><A NAME="1:28">1:28</A><DD>and the ignoble things of the world, and the despised, has God chosen, <I>and</I> things that are not, that he may annul the things that are;
<DT><A NAME="1:29">1:29</A><DD>so that no flesh should boast before God.
<DT><A NAME="1:30">1:30</A><DD>But of him are *ye* in Christ Jesus, who has been made to us wisdom from God, and righteousness, and <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1co?n=1:30">holiness</A>, and redemption;
<DT><A NAME="1:31">1:31</A><DD>that according as it is <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1co?n=1:31">written</A>, He that boasts, let him boast in <I>the</I> <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1co?n=1:31a">Lord</A>.
</DL></DIV><H2>Chapter 2</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="2:1">2:1</A><DD>And *I*, when I came to you, brethren, came not in excellency of word, or wisdom, announcing to you the testimony of God.
<DT><A NAME="2:2">2:2</A><DD>For I did not judge <I>it well</I> to <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1co?n=2:2">know</A> anything among you save Jesus Christ, and *him* crucified.
<DT><A NAME="2:3">2:3</A><DD>And *I* was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling;
<DT><A NAME="2:4">2:4</A><DD>and my word and my preaching, not in persuasive words of wisdom, but in demonstration of <I>the</I> Spirit and of power;
<DT><A NAME="2:5">2:5</A><DD>that your faith might not <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1co?n=2:5">stand</A> in men's wisdom, but in God's power.
<DT><A NAME="2:6">2:6</A><DD>But we speak wisdom among the perfect; but wisdom not of this <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1co?n=2:6">world</A>, nor of the rulers of this <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1co?n=2:6">world</A>, who come to nought.
<DT><A NAME="2:7">2:7</A><DD>But we speak God's wisdom in <I>a</I> mystery, that hidden <I>wisdom</I> which God had predetermined before the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1co?n=2:7">ages</A> for our glory:
<DT><A NAME="2:8">2:8</A><DD>which none of the princes of this <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1co?n=2:7">age</A> knew, (for had they known, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory;)
<DT><A NAME="2:9">2:9</A><DD>but according as it is <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1co?n=2:9">written</A>, Things which eye has not seen, and ear not heard, and which have not come into man's heart, which God has prepared for them that love him,
<DT><A NAME="2:10">2:10</A><DD>but God has revealed to us by <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1co?n=2:10"><I>his</I></A> Spirit; for the Spirit searches all things, even the depths of God.
<DT><A NAME="2:11">2:11</A><DD>For who of men hath known the things of a <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1co?n=2:11">man</A> except the spirit of the man which is in him? thus also the things of God knows no one except the Spirit of God.
<DT><A NAME="2:12">2:12</A><DD>But *we* have received, not the spirit of the world, but the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1co?n=2:12">Spirit</A> which <I>is</I> of God, that we may know the things which have been freely given to us of God:
<DT><A NAME="2:13">2:13</A><DD>which also we speak, not in words taught by human <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1co?n=2:13">wisdom</A>, but in those taught by the Spirit, <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1co?n=2:13a">communicating</A> spiritual <I>things</I> by spiritual <I>means</I>.
<DT><A NAME="2:14">2:14</A><DD>But <I>the</I> <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1co?n=2:14">natural</A> man does not receive the things of the Spirit of God, for they are folly to him; and he cannot know <I>them</I> because they are spiritually discerned;
<DT><A NAME="2:15">2:15</A><DD>but the spiritual discerns all things, and *he* is discerned of no one.
<DT><A NAME="2:16">2:16</A><DD>For who has known the mind of <I>the</I> Lord, who shall instruct <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1co?n=2:16">him</A>? But *we* have the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1co?n=2:16a">mind</A> of Christ.

<DT><A NAME="3:1">3:1</A><DD>And *I*, brethren, have not been able to speak to you as to spiritual, but as to <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1co?n=3:1">fleshly</A>; as to babes in Christ.
<DT><A NAME="3:2">3:2</A><DD>I have given you milk to drink, not meat, for ye have not yet been able, nor indeed are ye yet able;
<DT><A NAME="3:3">3:3</A><DD>for ye are yet <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1co?n=3:1">carnal</A>. For whereas <I>there are</I> among you emulation and strife, are ye not <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1co?n=3:1">carnal</A>, and walk according to man?
<DT><A NAME="3:4">3:4</A><DD>For when one says, *I* am of Paul, and another, *I* of Apollos, are ye not men?
<DT><A NAME="3:5">3:5</A><DD>Who then is Apollos, and who Paul? Ministering <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1co?n=3:5">servants</A>, through whom ye have believed, and as the Lord has given to each.
<DT><A NAME="3:6">3:6</A><DD>*I* have planted; Apollos watered; but God has given the increase.
<DT><A NAME="3:7">3:7</A><DD>So that neither the planter is anything, nor the waterer; but God the giver of the increase.
<DT><A NAME="3:8">3:8</A><DD>But the planter and the waterer are one; but each shall receive his own reward according to his own labour.
<DT><A NAME="3:9">3:9</A><DD>For we are God's <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1co?n=3:9">fellow-workmen</A>; ye are God's husbandry, God's building.
<DT><A NAME="3:10">3:10</A><DD>According to the grace of God which has been given to me, as a wise architect, I have laid the foundation, but another builds upon it. But let each see how he builds upon it.
<DT><A NAME="3:11">3:11</A><DD>For other foundation can no man lay besides that which <I>is</I> laid, which is Jesus Christ.

<DT><A NAME="3:13">3:13</A><DD>the work of each shall be made manifest; for the day shall declare <I>it</I>, because <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1co?n=3:13">it</A> is revealed in fire; and the fire shall try the work of each what it is.
<DT><A NAME="3:14">3:14</A><DD>If the work of any one which he has built upon <I>the foundation</I> shall abide, he shall receive a reward.
<DT><A NAME="3:15">3:15</A><DD>If the work of any one shall be consumed, he shall suffer loss, but *he* shall be saved, but so as through <I>the</I> <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1co?n=3:15">fire</A>.
<DT><A NAME="3:16">3:16</A><DD>Do ye not know that ye are <I>the</I> <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1co?n=3:16">temple</A> of God, and <I>that</I> the Spirit of God dwells in you?
<DT><A NAME="3:17">3:17</A><DD>If any one <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1co?n=3:17">corrupt</A> the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1co?n=3:16">temple</A> of God, *him* shall God <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1co?n=3:17">destroy</A>; for the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1co?n=3:16">temple</A> of God is holy, and such are *ye*.
<DT><A NAME="3:18">3:18</A><DD>Let no one <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1co?n=3:18">deceive</A> himself: if any one thinks himself to <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1co?n=3:18a">be</A> wise among you in this world, let him become foolish, that he may be wise.
<DT><A NAME="3:19">3:19</A><DD>For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God; for it is <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1co?n=3:19">written</A>, He who takes the wise in their craftiness.
<DT><A NAME="3:20">3:20</A><DD>And <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1co?n=3:20">again</A>, <I>The</I> Lord knows the reasonings of the wise that they are vain.
<DT><A NAME="3:21">3:21</A><DD>So that let no one boast in men; for all things are yours.

<DT><A NAME="4:1">4:1</A><DD>Let a man so account of us as <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1co?n=4:1">servants</A> of Christ, and stewards of <I>the</I> mysteries of God.
<DT><A NAME="4:2">4:2</A><DD>Here, further, it is sought in stewards, that a man be found faithful.
<DT><A NAME="4:3">4:3</A><DD>But for me it is the very smallest matter that I be <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1co?n=4:3">examined</A> of you or of man's day. Nor do I even examine myself.
<DT><A NAME="4:4">4:4</A><DD>For I am conscious of nothing in myself; but I am not justified by this: but he that examines me is the Lord.
<DT><A NAME="4:5">4:5</A><DD>So that do not judge anything before <I>the</I> time, until the Lord shall come, who shall also both bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and shall make manifest the counsels of hearts; and then shall each have <I>his</I> praise from <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1co?n=4:5">God</A>.
<DT><A NAME="4:6">4:6</A><DD>Now these things, brethren, I have transferred, in their <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1co?n=4:6">application</A>, to myself and Apollos, for your sakes, that ye may learn in us the <I>lesson of</I> not <I>letting your thoughts go</I> above what is written, that ye may not be puffed up one for <I>such a</I> one against another.
<DT><A NAME="4:7">4:7</A><DD>For who makes thee to differ? and what hast thou which thou hast not received? but if also thou hast received, why boastest thou as not receiving?
<DT><A NAME="4:8">4:8</A><DD>Already ye are filled; already ye have been enriched; ye have reigned without us; and I would that ye reigned, that *we* also might reign with you.
<DT><A NAME="4:9">4:9</A><DD>For I think that God has set us the apostles for the last, as appointed to death. For we have become a spectacle to the world, both to angels and men.
<DT><A NAME="4:10">4:10</A><DD>*We* <I>are</I> fools for Christ's sake, but *ye* prudent in Christ: *we* weak, but *ye* strong: *ye* glorious, but *we* in dishonour.

<DT><A NAME="4:15">4:15</A><DD>For if ye should have ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet not many fathers; for in Christ Jesus *I* have begotten you through the glad tidings.

</DL></DIV><H2>Chapter 15</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="15:1">15:1</A><DD>But I make known to you, brethren, the glad tidings which I <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1co?n=15:1">announced</A> to you, which also ye received, in which also ye stand,
<DT><A NAME="15:2">15:2</A><DD>by which also ye are saved, (if ye hold fast the word which I <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1co?n=15:1">announced</A> to you as the glad tidings,) unless indeed ye have believed in vain.
<DT><A NAME="15:3">15:3</A><DD>For I delivered to you, in the first place, what also I had received, that Christ died for our sins, according to the scriptures;
<DT><A NAME="15:4">15:4</A><DD>and that he was buried; and that he was raised the third day, according to the scriptures;
<DT><A NAME="15:5">15:5</A><DD>and that he appeared to Cephas, then to the twelve.
<DT><A NAME="15:6">15:6</A><DD>Then he appeared to above five hundred brethren at once, of whom the most remain until now, but some also have fallen asleep.
<DT><A NAME="15:7">15:7</A><DD>Then he appeared to James; then to all the apostles;
<DT><A NAME="15:8">15:8</A><DD>and last of all, as to an <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1co?n=15:8">abortion</A>, he appeared to *me* also.
<DT><A NAME="15:9">15:9</A><DD>For *I* am the least of the apostles, who am not fit to be called apostle, because I have persecuted the assembly of God.
<DT><A NAME="15:10">15:10</A><DD>But by God's grace I am what I am; and his grace, which <I>was</I> towards me, has not been vain; but I have laboured more abundantly than they all, but not *I*, but the grace of God which <I>was</I> with me.
<DT><A NAME="15:11">15:11</A><DD>Whether, therefore, I or they, thus we preach, and thus ye have believed.
<DT><A NAME="15:12">15:12</A><DD>Now if Christ is preached that he is <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1co?n=15:12">raised</A> from among <I>the</I> dead, how say some among you that there is not a resurrection of <I>those that are</I> dead?
<DT><A NAME="15:13">15:13</A><DD>But if there is not a resurrection of <I>those that are</I> dead, neither is Christ raised:
<DT><A NAME="15:14">15:14</A><DD>but if Christ is not raised, then, indeed, vain also <I>is</I> our preaching, and vain also your faith.
<DT><A NAME="15:15">15:15</A><DD>And we are found also false witnesses of God; for we have witnessed concerning God that he raised the Christ, whom he has not raised if indeed <I>those that are</I> dead are not <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1co?n=15:12">raised</A>.
<DT><A NAME="15:16">15:16</A><DD>For if <I>those that are</I> dead are not raised, neither is Christ <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1co?n=15:12">raised</A>;
<DT><A NAME="15:17">15:17</A><DD>but if Christ be not raised, your faith <I>is</I> vain; ye are yet in your sins.
<DT><A NAME="15:18">15:18</A><DD>Then indeed also those who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished.
<DT><A NAME="15:19">15:19</A><DD>If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are <I>the</I> most miserable of all men.
<DT><A NAME="15:20">15:20</A><DD>(But now Christ is raised from among <I>the</I> dead, first-fruits of those fallen asleep.
<DT><A NAME="15:21">15:21</A><DD>For since by man <I>came</I> death, by man also resurrection of <I>those that are</I> dead.
<DT><A NAME="15:22">15:22</A><DD>For as in the Adam all die, thus also in the Christ all shall be made alive.
<DT><A NAME="15:23">15:23</A><DD>But each in his own <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1co?n=15:23">rank</A>: <I>the</I> first-fruits, Christ; then those that are the Christ's at his coming.
<DT><A NAME="15:24">15:24</A><DD>Then the end, when he gives up the kingdom to him <I>who is</I> God and <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1co?n=15:24">Father</A>; when he shall have annulled all rule and all authority and power.
<DT><A NAME="15:25">15:25</A><DD>For he must reign until he put <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1co?n=15:25">all</A> enemies under his feet.
<DT><A NAME="15:26">15:26</A><DD><I>The</I> last enemy <I>that</I> is annulled <I>is</I> death.
<DT><A NAME="15:27">15:27</A><DD>For he has put all things in subjection under his <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1co?n=15:27">feet</A>. But when he says that all things are put in subjection, <I>it is</I> evident that <I>it is</I> except him who put all things in subjection to him.
<DT><A NAME="15:28">15:28</A><DD>But when all things shall have been brought into subjection to him, then the Son also himself shall be placed in subjection to him who put all things in subjection to him, that God may be all in all.)
<DT><A NAME="15:29">15:29</A><DD>Since what shall the baptised <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1co?n=15:29">for</A> the dead do if <I>those that are</I> dead rise not at all? why also are they baptised for them?
<DT><A NAME="15:30">15:30</A><DD>Why do *we* also endanger ourselves every hour?
<DT><A NAME="15:31">15:31</A><DD>Daily I die, by your boasting which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord.
<DT><A NAME="15:32">15:32</A><DD>If, <I>to speak</I> after the manner of man, I have fought with <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1co?n=15:32">beasts</A> in Ephesus, what is the profit to me if <I>those that are</I> dead do not rise? let us eat and drink; for to-morrow we <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1co?n=15:32a">die</A>.
<DT><A NAME="15:33">15:33</A><DD>Be not deceived: evil communications corrupt good manners.
<DT><A NAME="15:34">15:34</A><DD>Awake up righteously, and sin not; for some are <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1co?n=15:34">ignorant</A> of God: I speak to you as a matter of shame.
<DT><A NAME="15:35">15:35</A><DD>But some one will say, How are the dead raised? and with what body do they come?
<DT><A NAME="15:36">15:36</A><DD>Fool; what *thou* sowest is not quickened unless it die.
<DT><A NAME="15:37">15:37</A><DD>And what thou sowest, thou sowest not the body that shall be, but a bare grain: it may be of wheat, or some one of the rest:
<DT><A NAME="15:38">15:38</A><DD>and God gives to it a body as he has pleased, and to each of the seeds its own body.
<DT><A NAME="15:39">15:39</A><DD>Every flesh <I>is</I> not the same flesh, but one <I>is</I> of men, and another flesh of beasts, and another <I>flesh</I> of birds, and another of <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1co?n=15:39">fishes</A>.
<DT><A NAME="15:40">15:40</A><DD>And <I>there are</I> heavenly bodies, and earthly bodies: but different is the glory of the heavenly, different that of the earthly:
<DT><A NAME="15:41">15:41</A><DD>one <I>the</I> sun's glory, and another <I>the</I> moon's glory, and another <I>the</I> stars' glory; for star differs from star in glory.
<DT><A NAME="15:42">15:42</A><DD>Thus also <I>is</I> the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption, it is raised in incorruptibility.
<DT><A NAME="15:43">15:43</A><DD>It is sown in dishonour, it is raised in glory. It is sown in weakness, it is raised in power.
<DT><A NAME="15:44">15:44</A><DD>It is sown a <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1co?n=15:44">natural</A> body, it is raised a spiritual body: if there is a <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1co?n=15:44">natural</A> body, there is also a spiritual <I>one</I>.
<DT><A NAME="15:45">15:45</A><DD>Thus also it is <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1co?n=15:45">written</A>, The first man Adam became a living soul; the last Adam a <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1co?n=15:45a">quickening</A> spirit.
<DT><A NAME="15:46">15:46</A><DD>But that which is spiritual <I>was</I> not first, but that which is <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1co?n=15:44">natural</A>, then that which is spiritual:
<DT><A NAME="15:47">15:47</A><DD>the first man out of <I>the</I> earth, made of dust; the second man, out of heaven.
<DT><A NAME="15:48">15:48</A><DD>Such as he made of dust, such also those made of dust; and such as the heavenly <I>one</I>, such also the heavenly <I>ones</I>.
<DT><A NAME="15:49">15:49</A><DD>And as we have borne the image of the <I>one</I> made of dust, we shall bear also the image of the heavenly <I>one</I>.
<DT><A NAME="15:50">15:50</A><DD>But this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit God's kingdom, nor does corruption inherit incorruptibility.
<DT><A NAME="15:51">15:51</A><DD>Behold, I tell you a mystery: We shall not all fall asleep, but we shall all be changed,
<DT><A NAME="15:52">15:52</A><DD>in an instant, in <I>the</I> twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet; for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and *we* shall be changed.
<DT><A NAME="15:53">15:53</A><DD>For this corruptible must needs put on incorruptibility, and this mortal put on immortality.
<DT><A NAME="15:54">15:54</A><DD>But when this corruptible shall have put on incorruptibility, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall come to pass the word <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1co?n=15:54">written</A>: Death has been swallowed up in victory.
<DT><A NAME="15:55">15:55</A><DD>Where, O death, <I>is</I> thy sting? where, O death, thy <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1co?n=15:55">victory</A>?
<DT><A NAME="15:56">15:56</A><DD>Now the sting of death <I>is</I> sin, and the power of sin the law;
<DT><A NAME="15:57">15:57</A><DD>but thanks to God, who gives us the victory by our Lord Jesus Christ.
<DT><A NAME="15:58">15:58</A><DD>So then, my beloved brethren, be firm, immovable, abounding always in the work of the Lord, knowing that your toil is not in vain in <I>the</I> Lord.
</DL></DIV><H2>Chapter 16</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="16:1">16:1</A><DD>Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1co?n=16:1">directed</A> the assemblies of Galatia, so do *ye* do also.
<DT><A NAME="16:2">16:2</A><DD>On <I>the</I> first of <I>the</I> week let each of you put by at home, laying up <I>in</I> whatever <I>degree</I> he may have prospered, that there may be no collections when I come.
<DT><A NAME="16:3">16:3</A><DD>And when I am arrived, whomsoever ye shall approve, these I will send with <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1co?n=16:3">letters</A> to carry your bounty to Jerusalem:
<DT><A NAME="16:4">16:4</A><DD>and if it be suitable that *I* also should go, they shall go with me.
<DT><A NAME="16:5">16:5</A><DD>But I will come to you when I shall have gone through Macedonia; for I do go through Macedonia.
<DT><A NAME="16:6">16:6</A><DD>But perhaps I will stay with you, or even winter with you, that *ye* may set me forward wheresoever I may go.
<DT><A NAME="16:7">16:7</A><DD>For I <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1co?n=16:7">will</A> not see you now in passing, for I hope to remain a certain time with you, if the Lord permit.
<DT><A NAME="16:8">16:8</A><DD>But I remain in Ephesus until Pentecost.
<DT><A NAME="16:9">16:9</A><DD>For a great door is opened to me and an effectual <I>one</I>, and <I>the</I> adversaries many.
<DT><A NAME="16:10">16:10</A><DD>Now if Timotheus come, see that he may be with you without fear; for he works the work of the Lord, even as I.
<DT><A NAME="16:11">16:11</A><DD>Let not therefore any one despise him; but set him forward in peace, that he may come to me; for I expect him with the brethren.
<DT><A NAME="16:12">16:12</A><DD>Now concerning the brother Apollos, I begged him <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1co?n=16:12">much</A> that he would go to you with the brethren; but it was not at all <I>his</I> <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1co?n=16:12a">will</A> to go now; but he will come when he shall have good opportunity.
<DT><A NAME="16:13">16:13</A><DD>Be vigilant; stand fast in the faith; quit yourselves like men; be strong.
<DT><A NAME="16:14">16:14</A><DD>Let all things ye <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1co?n=16:14">do</A> be done in love.
<DT><A NAME="16:15">16:15</A><DD>But I beseech you, brethren, (ye <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1co?n=16:15">know</A> the house of Stephanas, that it is the first-fruits of Achaia, and they have devoted <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_1co?n=16:15a">themselves</A> to the saints for service,)
<DT><A NAME="16:16">16:16</A><DD>that *ye* should also be subject to such, and to every one joined in the work and labouring.
<DT><A NAME="16:17">16:17</A><DD>But I rejoice in the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus; because *they* have supplied what was lacking on your part.
<DT><A NAME="16:18">16:18</A><DD>For they have refreshed my spirit and yours: own therefore such.
<DT><A NAME="16:19">16:19</A><DD>The assemblies of Asia salute you. Aquila and Priscilla, with the assembly in their house, salute you much in <I>the</I> Lord.
