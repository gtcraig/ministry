<DT><A NAME="2:5">2:5</A><DD>(we too being dead in offences,) has quickened us with the Christ, (ye are <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_eph?n=2:5">saved</A> by grace,)
<DT><A NAME="2:6">2:6</A><DD>and has raised <I>us</I> up together, and has made <I>us</I> sit down together in the heavenlies in Christ Jesus,
<DT><A NAME="2:7">2:7</A><DD>that he might display in the coming ages the surpassing riches of his grace in kindness towards <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_eph?n=2:7">us</A> in Christ Jesus.
<DT><A NAME="2:8">2:8</A><DD>For ye are saved by grace, through faith; and this not of yourselves; it is God's gift:
<DT><A NAME="2:9">2:9</A><DD>not on the principle of works, that no one might boast.
<DT><A NAME="2:10">2:10</A><DD>For we are his workmanship, having been created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God has before prepared that we should walk in them.
<DT><A NAME="2:11">2:11</A><DD>Wherefore remember that *ye*, once nations in <I>the</I> flesh, who <I>are</I> called uncircumcision by that called circumcision in <I>the</I> flesh done with the hand;
<DT><A NAME="2:12">2:12</A><DD>that ye were at that time without Christ, aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers to the covenants of promise, having no hope, and without <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_eph?n=2:12">God</A> in the world:
<DT><A NAME="2:13">2:13</A><DD>but now in Christ Jesus *ye* who once were afar off are become nigh by the blood of the Christ.
<DT><A NAME="2:14">2:14</A><DD>For *he* is our peace, who has made both one, and has broken down the middle wall of enclosure,
<DT><A NAME="2:15">2:15</A><DD>having annulled the enmity in his flesh, the law of commandments in ordinances, that he might form the two in himself into one new man, making peace;
<DT><A NAME="2:16">2:16</A><DD>and might reconcile both in one body to God by the cross, having by it slain the enmity;
<DT><A NAME="2:17">2:17</A><DD>and, coming, he has preached the glad tidings of peace to you who <I>were</I> afar off, and <I>the glad tidings of</I> peace to those <I>who were</I> nigh.
<DT><A NAME="2:18">2:18</A><DD>For through him we have both access by one Spirit to the Father.
<DT><A NAME="2:19">2:19</A><DD>So then ye are no longer strangers and foreigners, but ye are fellow-citizens of the saints, and of the household of God,

<DT><A NAME="5:22">5:22</A><DD>Wives, <I>submit yourselves</I> to your own husbands, as to the Lord,
<DT><A NAME="5:23">5:23</A><DD>for a <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_eph?n=5:23">husband</A> is head of the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_eph?n=5:23a">wife</A>, as also the Christ <I>is</I> head of the assembly. *He* <I>is</I> Saviour of the body.

<DT><A NAME="5:28">5:28</A><DD>So ought men also to love their own wives as their own bodies: he that loves his own wife loves himself.
<DT><A NAME="5:29">5:29</A><DD>For no one has ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, even as also the Christ the assembly:
<DT><A NAME="5:30">5:30</A><DD>for we are members of his body; <I>we are of his flesh, and of his bones.</I>
<DT><A NAME="5:31">5:31</A><DD>Because of this a man shall leave his father and mother, and shall be united to his wife, and the two shall <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_eph?n=5:31">be</A> one <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_eph?n=5:31a">flesh</A>.
<DT><A NAME="5:32">5:32</A><DD>This mystery is great, but *I* speak as to Christ, and as to the assembly.
