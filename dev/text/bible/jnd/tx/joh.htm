<DT><A NAME="1:4">1:4</A><DD>In him was life, and the life was the light of <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_joh?n=1:4">men</A>.
<DT><A NAME="1:5">1:5</A><DD>And the light appears in darkness, and the darkness apprehended it not.
<DT><A NAME="1:6">1:6</A><DD>There was a man sent <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_joh?n=1:6">from</A> God, his name John.
<DT><A NAME="1:7">1:7</A><DD>He came for witness, that he might witness concerning the light, that all might believe through him.
<DT><A NAME="1:8">1:8</A><DD>*He* was not the light, but that he might witness concerning the light.
<DT><A NAME="1:9">1:9</A><DD>The true light was that which, coming into the world, <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_joh?n=1:9">lightens</A> every man.
<DT><A NAME="1:10">1:10</A><DD>He was in the world, and the world had <I>its</I> being through him, and the world knew him not.
<DT><A NAME="1:11">1:11</A><DD>He came to his <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_joh?n=1:11">own</A>, and his own received him not;
<DT><A NAME="1:12">1:12</A><DD>but as many as received him, to them gave he <I>the</I> <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_joh?n=1:12">right</A> to be <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_joh?n=1:12a">children</A> of God, to those that believe <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_joh?n=1:12b">on</A> his name;
<DT><A NAME="1:13">1:13</A><DD>who have been born, not of blood, nor of flesh's will, nor of man's will, but of God.
<DT><A NAME="1:14">1:14</A><DD>And the Word became flesh, and <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_joh?n=1:14">dwelt</A> among us (and we have contemplated his glory, a glory as of an only-begotten <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_joh?n=1:14a">with</A> a father), full of grace and truth;
<DT><A NAME="1:15">1:15</A><DD>(John bears witness of him, and he has cried, saying, This was he of whom I said, He that comes after me is preferred before me, for he was before me;)
<DT><A NAME="1:16">1:16</A><DD>for of his fulness we all have received, and grace upon grace.
<DT><A NAME="1:17">1:17</A><DD>For the law was given by Moses: grace and truth <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_joh?n=1:17">subsists</A> through Jesus Christ.
<DT><A NAME="1:18">1:18</A><DD>No one has seen God at any time; the only-begotten Son, who is <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_joh?n=1:18">in</A> the bosom of the Father, *he* hath declared <I>him</I>.
<DT><A NAME="1:19">1:19</A><DD>And this is the witness of John, when the Jews sent from Jerusalem priests and Levites that they might ask him, Thou, who art thou?
<DT><A NAME="1:20">1:20</A><DD>And he acknowledged and denied not, and acknowledged, I am not the Christ.
<DT><A NAME="1:21">1:21</A><DD>And they asked him, What then? Art thou Elias? And he says, I am not. Art thou the prophet? And he answered, No.
<DT><A NAME="1:22">1:22</A><DD>They said therefore to him, Who art thou? that we may give an answer to those who sent us. What sayest thou of thyself?
<DT><A NAME="1:23">1:23</A><DD>He said, I <I>am</I> <I>the</I> voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the path of <I>the</I> <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_joh?n=1:23">Lord</A>, as said Esaias the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_joh?n=1:23a">prophet</A>.
<DT><A NAME="1:24">1:24</A><DD>And they were sent from among the Pharisees.
<DT><A NAME="1:25">1:25</A><DD>And they asked him and said to him, Why baptisest thou then, if thou art not the Christ, nor Elias, nor the prophet?
<DT><A NAME="1:26">1:26</A><DD>John answered them saying, I baptise with water. In the midst of you <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_joh?n=1:26">stands</A>, whom ye do not know,
<DT><A NAME="1:27">1:27</A><DD>he who comes after me, the thong of whose sandal I am not worthy to unloose.
<DT><A NAME="1:28">1:28</A><DD>These things took place in Bethany, across the Jordan, where John was baptising.
<DT><A NAME="1:29">1:29</A><DD>On the morrow he sees Jesus coming to him, and says, Behold the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world.
<DT><A NAME="1:30">1:30</A><DD>He it is of whom I said, A man comes after me who takes a place before me, because he *was* before me;
<DT><A NAME="1:31">1:31</A><DD>and I knew him not; but that he might be manifested to Israel, therefore have I come baptising with water.
<DT><A NAME="1:32">1:32</A><DD>And John bore witness, saying, I beheld the Spirit descending as a dove from heaven, and it abode upon him.
<DT><A NAME="1:33">1:33</A><DD>And I knew him not; but he who sent me to baptise with water, *he* said to me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending and abiding on him, he it is who baptises with <I>the</I> Holy Spirit.
<DT><A NAME="1:34">1:34</A><DD>And I have seen and borne witness that this is the Son of God.
<DT><A NAME="1:35">1:35</A><DD>Again, on the morrow, there stood John and two of his disciples.
<DT><A NAME="1:36">1:36</A><DD>And, looking at Jesus as he walked, he says, Behold the Lamb of God.
<DT><A NAME="1:37">1:37</A><DD>And the two disciples heard him speaking, and followed Jesus.
<DT><A NAME="1:38">1:38</A><DD>But Jesus having turned, and seeing them following, says to them, <FONT CLASS=r>What seek ye?</FONT> And *they* said to him, Rabbi (which, being interpreted, signifies Teacher), where abidest thou?
<DT><A NAME="1:39">1:39</A><DD>He says to them, <FONT CLASS=r>Come and see.</FONT> They went therefore, and saw where he <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_joh?n=1:39">abode</A>; and they abode with him that day. It was about the tenth hour.
<DT><A NAME="1:40">1:40</A><DD>Andrew, the brother of Simon Peter, was one of the two who heard <I>this</I> from John and followed him.
<DT><A NAME="1:41">1:41</A><DD>He first finds his own brother Simon, and says to him, We have found the Messias (which being interpreted is Christ).
<DT><A NAME="1:42">1:42</A><DD>And he led him to Jesus. Jesus looking <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_joh?n=1:42">at</A> him said, <FONT CLASS=r>Thou art Simon, the son of Jonas; thou shalt be called Cephas</FONT> (which interpreted is <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_joh?n=1:42a">stone</A>).
<DT><A NAME="1:43">1:43</A><DD>On the morrow he would go forth into Galilee, and Jesus finds Philip, and says to him, <FONT CLASS=r>Follow me.</FONT>
<DT><A NAME="1:44">1:44</A><DD>And Philip was from Bethsaida, of the city of Andrew and Peter.
<DT><A NAME="1:45">1:45</A><DD>Philip finds Nathanael, and says to him, We have found him of whom Moses wrote in the law, and the prophets, Jesus, the son of Joseph, who is from Nazareth.
<DT><A NAME="1:46">1:46</A><DD>And Nathanael said to him, Can anything good <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_joh?n=1:46">come</A> out of Nazareth? Philip says to him, Come and see.
<DT><A NAME="1:47">1:47</A><DD>Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and says of him, <FONT CLASS=r>Behold <I>one</I> truly an Israelite, in whom there is no guile.</FONT>
<DT><A NAME="1:48">1:48</A><DD>Nathanael says to him, Whence knowest thou me? Jesus answered and said to him, <FONT CLASS=r>Before that Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig-tree, I saw thee.</FONT>
<DT><A NAME="1:49">1:49</A><DD>Nathanael answered and said to him, Rabbi, thou art the Son of God, thou art the King of Israel.
<DT><A NAME="1:50">1:50</A><DD>Jesus answered and said to him, <FONT CLASS=r>Because I said to thee, I saw thee under the fig-tree, believest thou? Thou shalt see greater things than these.</FONT>
<DT><A NAME="1:51">1:51</A><DD>And he says to him, <FONT CLASS=r>Verily, verily, I say to you, Henceforth ye shall see the heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of man.</FONT>
</DL></DIV><H2>Chapter 2</H2><DIV CLASS=s><DL>
<DT><A NAME="2:1">2:1</A><DD>And on the third day a marriage took place in Cana of Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there.
<DT><A NAME="2:2">2:2</A><DD>And Jesus also, and his disciples, were invited to the marriage.
<DT><A NAME="2:3">2:3</A><DD>And wine being deficient, the mother of Jesus says to him, They have no wine.
<DT><A NAME="2:4">2:4</A><DD>Jesus says to her, <FONT CLASS=r>What have I to do with thee, woman? mine hour has not yet come.</FONT>
<DT><A NAME="2:5">2:5</A><DD>His mother says to the servants, Whatever he may say to you, do.
<DT><A NAME="2:6">2:6</A><DD>Now there were standing there six stone water-vessels, according to the purification of the Jews, holding two or three measures each.
<DT><A NAME="2:7">2:7</A><DD>Jesus says to them, <FONT CLASS=r>Fill the water-vessels with water.</FONT> And they filled them up to the brim.
<DT><A NAME="2:8">2:8</A><DD>And he says to them, <FONT CLASS=r>Draw out now, and carry <I>it</I> to the feast-master.</FONT> And they carried <I>it</I>.
<DT><A NAME="2:9">2:9</A><DD>But when the feast-master had tasted the water which had been made wine (and knew not whence it <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_joh?n=2:9">was</A>, but the servants knew who drew the water), the feast-master calls the bridegroom,
<DT><A NAME="2:10">2:10</A><DD>and says to him, Every man sets on first the good wine, and when <I>men</I> have well drunk, then the inferior; thou hast kept the good wine till now.
<DT><A NAME="2:11">2:11</A><DD>This beginning of signs did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested his glory; and his disciples believed <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_joh?n=2:11">on</A> him.
<DT><A NAME="2:12">2:12</A><DD>After this he descended to Capernaum, he and his mother and his brethren and his disciples; and there they abode not many days.
<DT><A NAME="2:13">2:13</A><DD>And the passover of the Jews was near, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
<DT><A NAME="2:14">2:14</A><DD>And he found in the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_joh?n=2:14">temple</A> the sellers of oxen and sheep and doves, and the money-changers sitting;
<DT><A NAME="2:15">2:15</A><DD>and, having made a scourge of cords, he cast <I>them</I> all out of the temple, <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_joh?n=2:15">both</A> the sheep and the oxen; and he poured out the change of the money-changers, and overturned the tables,
<DT><A NAME="2:16">2:16</A><DD>and said to the sellers of doves, <FONT CLASS=r>Take these things hence; make not my Father's house a house of merchandise.</FONT>
<DT><A NAME="2:17">2:17</A><DD><I>And</I> his disciples remembered that it is <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_joh?n=2:17">written</A>, The zeal of thy house devours me.
<DT><A NAME="2:18">2:18</A><DD>The Jews therefore answered and said to him, What sign shewest thou to us, that thou doest these things?
<DT><A NAME="2:19">2:19</A><DD>Jesus answered and said to them, <FONT CLASS=r>Destroy this <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_joh?n=2:19">temple</A>, and in three days I will raise it up.</FONT>
<DT><A NAME="2:20">2:20</A><DD>The Jews therefore said, Forty and six years was this <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_joh?n=2:19">temple</A> building, and thou wilt raise it up in three days?
<DT><A NAME="2:21">2:21</A><DD>But *he* spoke of the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_joh?n=2:19">temple</A> of his body.
<DT><A NAME="2:22">2:22</A><DD>When therefore he was raised from among <I>the</I> dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this, and believed the scripture and the word which Jesus had spoken.
<DT><A NAME="2:23">2:23</A><DD>And when he was in Jerusalem, at the passover, at the feast, many believed <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_joh?n=2:11">on</A> his name, beholding his signs which he wrought.
<DT><A NAME="2:24">2:24</A><DD>But Jesus himself did not trust himself to them, because he knew all <I>men</I>,
<DT><A NAME="2:25">2:25</A><DD>and that he had not need that any should testify of man, for himself <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_joh?n=2:25">knew</A> what was in man.

<DT><A NAME="3:1">3:1</A><DD>But there was a man from among the Pharisees, his name Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews;
<DT><A NAME="3:2">3:2</A><DD>he came to him by night, and said to him, Rabbi, we know that thou art come a teacher from God, for none can do these signs that thou doest unless God be with him.
<DT><A NAME="3:3">3:3</A><DD>Jesus answered and said to him, <FONT CLASS=r>Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except any one be born <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_joh?n=3:3">anew</A> he cannot see the kingdom of God.</FONT>

<DT><A NAME="4:43">4:43</A><DD>But after the two days he went forth thence and went away into Galilee,

<DT><A NAME="4:45">4:45</A><DD>When therefore he came into Galilee, the Galileans received him, having seen all that he had done in Jerusalem during the feast, for they also went to the feast.

<DT><A NAME="5:1">5:1</A><DD>After these things was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
<DT><A NAME="5:2">5:2</A><DD>Now there is in Jerusalem, at the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_joh?n=5:2">sheepgate</A>, a pool, which is called in Hebrew, Bethesda, having five porches.

<DT><A NAME="5:5">5:5</A><DD>But there was a certain man there who had been suffering under his infirmity thirty and eight years.
<DT><A NAME="5:6">5:6</A><DD>Jesus seeing this <I>man</I> lying <I>there</I>, and knowing that he was <I>in that state</I> now a great length of time, says to him, <FONT CLASS=r>Wouldest thou become well?</FONT>
