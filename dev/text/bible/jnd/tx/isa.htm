<DT><A NAME="1:2">1:2</A><DD>Hear, <I>ye</I> heavens, and give ear, <I>thou</I> earth! for Jehovah hath spoken: I have nourished and brought up children; and they have <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_isa?n=1:2">rebelled</A> against me.
<DT><A NAME="1:3">1:3</A><DD>The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master's crib; Israel doth not know, my people hath no intelligence.
<DT><A NAME="1:4">1:4</A><DD><A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_isa?n=1:4">Ah</A> sinful <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_isa?n=1:4a">nation</A>, a people laden with iniquity, a seed of evildoers, children that corrupt themselves! They have forsaken Jehovah; they have despised the Holy One of Israel; they are turned <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_isa?n=1:4b">away</A> backward.
<DT><A NAME="1:5">1:5</A><DD>Why should ye be smitten any more? ye will revolt more and <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_isa?n=1:5">more</A>: the whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint.
<DT><A NAME="1:6">1:6</A><DD>From the sole of the foot even unto the head there is no soundness in him; wounds, and weals, and open sores: they have not been dressed, nor bound up, nor mollified with oil.
<DT><A NAME="1:7">1:7</A><DD>Your country is desolate; your cities are burned with fire; your land, strangers eat it up in your presence, and it is desolate, as overthrown by strangers.
<DT><A NAME="1:8">1:8</A><DD>And the daughter of Zion is left, as a booth in a vineyard, as a night-lodge in a cucumber-garden, as a besieged city.

<DT><A NAME="1:21">1:21</A><DD>How is the faithful city become a harlot! It was full of judgment; righteousness used to lodge in it, but now murderers.
<DT><A NAME="1:22">1:22</A><DD>Thy silver is become dross, thy wine is mixed with water:
<DT><A NAME="1:23">1:23</A><DD>thy princes are rebellious, and companions of thieves; every one loveth presents, and hunteth after rewards; they judge not the fatherless, and the cause of the widow cometh not unto them.
<DT><A NAME="1:24">1:24</A><DD>Therefore <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_isa?n=1:24">saith</A> the Lord, Jehovah of <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_isa?n=1:24a">hosts</A>, the Mighty One of Israel: Ah! I will ease <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_isa?n=1:24b">me</A> of mine adversaries, and avenge me of mine enemies.

<DT><A NAME="2:4">2:4</A><DD>And he shall judge among the nations, and shall reprove many peoples; and they shall forge their swords into ploughshares, and their spears into pruning-knives: nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.
<DT><A NAME="2:5">2:5</A><DD>House of Jacob, come ye, and let us walk in the light of Jehovah.
<DT><A NAME="2:6">2:6</A><DD>For thou hast cast off thy people, the house of Jacob, because they are filled <I>with what comes</I> from the east, and use auguries like the Philistines, and ally <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_isa?n=2:6">themselves</A> with the children of foreigners.
