<DT><A NAME="1:3">1:3</A><DD>Tell your children of it, and <I>let</I> your children <I>tell</I> their children, and their children another generation:
<DT><A NAME="1:4">1:4</A><DD>that which the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_joe?n=1:4">palmer-worm</A> hath left hath the locust eaten; and that which the locust hath left hath the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_joe?n=1:4">cankerworm</A> eaten; and that which the cankerworm hath left hath the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_joe?n=1:4a">caterpillar</A> eaten.
<DT><A NAME="1:5">1:5</A><DD>Awake, ye drunkards, and weep; and howl, all ye drinkers of wine, because of the new wine: for it is cut off from your mouth.
<DT><A NAME="1:6">1:6</A><DD>For a nation is come up upon my land, strong and without number: his teeth are the teeth of a lion, and he hath the cheek teeth of a lioness.
<DT><A NAME="1:7">1:7</A><DD>He hath made my vine a desolation, and barked my fig-tree; he hath made it clean bare, and cast it away: its branches are made white.
<DT><A NAME="1:8">1:8</A><DD>Wail like a virgin girded with sackcloth for the husband of her youth.
<DT><A NAME="1:9">1:9</A><DD>The oblation and the drink-offering are cut off from the house of Jehovah; the priests, Jehovah's ministers, mourn.
<DT><A NAME="1:10">1:10</A><DD>The field is laid waste, the land mourneth; for the corn is wasted, the new wine is dried <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_joe?n=1:10">up</A>, the oil languisheth.
<DT><A NAME="1:11">1:11</A><DD>Be ashamed, ye husbandmen; howl, ye vinedressers, for the wheat and for the barley: because the harvest of the field hath perished.
<DT><A NAME="1:12">1:12</A><DD>The vine is dried <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_joe?n=1:10">up</A>, and the fig-tree languisheth; the pomegranate-tree, the palm also and the apple-tree; all the trees of the field are withered, yea, joy is withered away from the children of men.
<DT><A NAME="1:13">1:13</A><DD>Gird yourselves, and lament, ye priests; howl, ministers of the altar; come, lie all night in sackcloth, ye ministers of my God: for the oblation and the drink-offering are withholden from the house of your God.
<DT><A NAME="1:14">1:14</A><DD>Hallow a fast, proclaim a solemn assembly, gather the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_joe?n=1:14">elders</A>, <I>and</I> all the inhabitants of the land to the house of Jehovah your God, and cry unto Jehovah.
<DT><A NAME="1:15">1:15</A><DD>Alas for the day! for the day of Jehovah is at hand, and as destruction from the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_joe?n=1:15">Almighty</A> shall it come.
<DT><A NAME="1:16">1:16</A><DD>Is not the food cut off before our eyes, joy and gladness from the house of our God?
<DT><A NAME="1:17">1:17</A><DD>The seeds are rotten under their clods, the granaries are laid desolate, the barns are broken down; for the corn is withered.
<DT><A NAME="1:18">1:18</A><DD>How do the beasts groan! The herds of cattle are bewildered, for they have no pasture; the flocks of sheep also are in suffering.
<DT><A NAME="1:19">1:19</A><DD>To thee, Jehovah, do I cry; for the fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness, and the flame hath burned up all the trees of the field.
<DT><A NAME="1:20">1:20</A><DD>The beasts of the field also cry unto thee; for the water-courses are dried, and the fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness.

<DT><A NAME="2:2">2:2</A><DD>a day of darkness and gloom, a day of clouds and gross darkness, as the dawn spread upon the mountains; -- a great people and a strong; there hath not been ever the like, neither shall be any more after them, to the years of generations and generations.
<DT><A NAME="2:3">2:3</A><DD>A fire devoureth before them, and behind them a flame burneth; the land is as a garden of Eden before them, and behind them a desolate wilderness: yea, and nothing escapeth them.
<DT><A NAME="2:4">2:4</A><DD>The appearance of them is as the appearance of horses; and as horsemen, so they run.
<DT><A NAME="2:5">2:5</A><DD>Like the noise of chariots, on the tops of the mountains, they leap; like the noise of a flame of fire that devoureth the stubble, as a strong people set in battle array.
<DT><A NAME="2:6">2:6</A><DD>Before them the peoples are in anguish: all faces turn pale.
<DT><A NAME="2:7">2:7</A><DD>They run like mighty men; they climb the wall like men of war; and they march every one on his ways, and break not their ranks.
<DT><A NAME="2:8">2:8</A><DD>Neither doth one press upon another; they march every one in his path; and fall <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_joe?n=2:8">amid</A> weapons, but are not <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_joe?n=2:8a">wounded</A>.
<DT><A NAME="2:9">2:9</A><DD>They spread themselves over the city; they run upon the wall; they climb up into the houses; they enter in by the windows like a thief.
<DT><A NAME="2:10">2:10</A><DD>The earth quaketh before them; the heavens tremble; the sun and the moon are darkened, and the stars withdraw their shining.
<DT><A NAME="2:11">2:11</A><DD>And Jehovah uttereth his voice before his army; for his camp is very great; for strong is he that executeth his word: for the day of Jehovah is great and very terrible; and who can bear it?
<DT><A NAME="2:12">2:12</A><DD>Yet even now, <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_joe?n=2:12">saith</A> Jehovah, turn to me with all your heart, and with fasting, and with weeping, and with mourning;
<DT><A NAME="2:13">2:13</A><DD>and rend your heart, and not your garments, and turn unto Jehovah your God: for he is gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of great <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_joe?n=2:13">loving-kindness</A>, and repenteth him of the evil.
<DT><A NAME="2:14">2:14</A><DD>Who knoweth? He might return and <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_joe?n=2:14">repent</A>, and leave a blessing behind him, an oblation and a drink-offering for Jehovah your God?
<DT><A NAME="2:15">2:15</A><DD>Blow the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_joe?n=2:15">trumpet</A> in Zion, hallow a fast, proclaim a solemn assembly;
<DT><A NAME="2:16">2:16</A><DD>gather the people, hallow the congregation, assemble the elders, gather the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_joe?n=2:16">children</A>, and those that suck the breasts; let the bridegroom go forth from his chamber, and the bride from her closet.
<DT><A NAME="2:17">2:17</A><DD>Let the priests, the ministers of Jehovah, weep between the porch and the altar, and let them say, Spare, O Jehovah, thy people, and give not thine inheritance to reproach, that they should be a byword of the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_joe?n=2:17">nations</A>. Wherefore should they say among the peoples, Where is their God?
<DT><A NAME="2:18">2:18</A><DD>Then Jehovah will be jealous for his land, and will have pity on his people.
<DT><A NAME="2:19">2:19</A><DD>And Jehovah will answer and say unto his people, Behold, I send you corn, and new wine, and oil, and ye shall be satisfied therewith; and I will no more make you a reproach among the nations.
<DT><A NAME="2:20">2:20</A><DD>And I will remove far off from you him <I>that cometh</I> from the north, and will drive him into a land barren and desolate, his face toward the eastern sea, and his rear toward the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_joe?n=2:20">hinder</A> sea; and his stench shall come up, and his ill odour shall come up, for he hath exalted himself to do great things.
<DT><A NAME="2:21">2:21</A><DD>-- Fear not, O land; be glad and rejoice: for Jehovah doeth great things.
<DT><A NAME="2:22">2:22</A><DD>Be not afraid, ye beasts of the field: for the pastures of the wilderness do spring; for the tree beareth its fruit; the fig-tree and the vine yield full <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_joe?n=2:22">increase</A>.
<DT><A NAME="2:23">2:23</A><DD>And ye, children of Zion, be glad and rejoice in Jehovah your God; for he giveth you the early rain in due <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_joe?n=2:23">measure</A>, and he causeth to come down for you the rain, the early <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_joe?n=2:23a">rain</A>, and the latter rain at the beginning <I>of the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_joe?n=2:23b">season</A>.</I>
<DT><A NAME="2:24">2:24</A><DD>And the floors shall be full of corn, and the vats shall overflow with new wine and oil.
<DT><A NAME="2:25">2:25</A><DD>And I will restore to you the years that the locust hath eaten, the cankerworm, and the caterpillar, and the palmer-worm, my great army which I sent among you.
<DT><A NAME="2:26">2:26</A><DD>And ye shall eat in plenty, and be satisfied, and praise the name of Jehovah your God, who hath dealt wondrously with you: and my people shall never be ashamed.
<DT><A NAME="2:27">2:27</A><DD>And ye shall know that I am in the midst of Israel, and that I, Jehovah, <I>am</I> your God, and there is none else: and my people shall never be ashamed.
<DT><A NAME="2:28">2:28</A><DD><A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_joe?n=2:28">*</A> And it shall come to pass afterwards <I>that</I> I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions.
<DT><A NAME="2:29">2:29</A><DD>Yea, even upon the bondmen and upon the handmaids in those days will I pour out my Spirit.
<DT><A NAME="2:30">2:30</A><DD>And I will <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_joe?n=2:30">shew</A> wonders in the heavens and on the earth, blood, and fire, and pillars of smoke.
<DT><A NAME="2:31">2:31</A><DD>The sun shall be changed to darkness, and the moon to blood, before the great and terrible day of Jehovah come.
<DT><A NAME="2:32">2:32</A><DD>And it shall be that whosoever shall call upon the name of Jehovah shall be saved: for in mount Zion and in Jerusalem shall be <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_joe?n=2:32">deliverance</A>, as Jehovah hath said, and for the residue whom Jehovah shall call.

<DT><A NAME="3:1">3:1</A><DD>For behold, in those days, and in that time, when I shall turn again the captivity of Judah and Jerusalem,
<DT><A NAME="3:2">3:2</A><DD>I will also gather all the nations, and will bring them down into the valley of <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_joe?n=3:2">Jehoshaphat</A>, and I will enter into judgment with them there on account of my people and mine inheritance, Israel, whom they have scattered among the nations: and they have parted my land;
<DT><A NAME="3:3">3:3</A><DD>and they have cast lots for my people, and have given a boy for a harlot, and sold a girl for wine, and have drunk <I>it</I>.
<DT><A NAME="3:4">3:4</A><DD>Yea also, what have ye to do with me, O Tyre and Zidon, and all the districts of Philistia? Will ye render me a recompence? But if ye recompense me, swiftly <I>and</I> speedily will I bring your recompence upon your own head;
<DT><A NAME="3:5">3:5</A><DD>because ye have taken my silver and my gold, and have carried into your temples my beautiful pleasant things,
<DT><A NAME="3:6">3:6</A><DD>and the children of Judah and the children of Jerusalem have ye sold unto the children of the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_joe?n=3:6">Greeks</A>, that ye might remove them far from their border.
<DT><A NAME="3:7">3:7</A><DD>Behold, I will raise them up out of the place whither ye have sold them, and will bring your recompence upon your own head.
<DT><A NAME="3:8">3:8</A><DD>And I will sell your sons and your daughters into the hand of the children of Judah, and they shall sell them to the Sabeans, to a nation far off: for Jehovah hath spoken.

<DT><A NAME="3:12">3:12</A><DD>Let the nations rouse themselves, and come up to the valley of Jehoshaphat; for there will I sit to judge all the nations round about.
<DT><A NAME="3:13">3:13</A><DD>Put in the sickle, for the harvest is ripe: come, get you down, for the press is full, the vats overflow; for their wickedness is great.
<DT><A NAME="3:14">3:14</A><DD>Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_joe?n=3:14">decision</A>! For the day of Jehovah is at hand in the valley of <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_joe?n=3:14">decision</A>.
<DT><A NAME="3:15">3:15</A><DD>The sun and the moon shall be darkened, and the stars shall withdraw their shining.

<DT><A NAME="3:17">3:17</A><DD>And ye shall know that I, Jehovah, <I>am</I> your God, dwelling in Zion, my holy mountain; and Jerusalem shall be holy, and no strangers shall pass through her any more.
<DT><A NAME="3:18">3:18</A><DD>And it shall come to pass in that day, that the mountains shall drop down new wine, and the hills shall flow with milk, and all the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_joe?n=3:18">water-courses</A> of Judah shall flow with waters; and a fountain shall come forth from the house of Jehovah, and shall water the valley of <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dr/n_joe?n=3:18a">Shittim</A>.
<DT><A NAME="3:19">3:19</A><DD>Egypt shall be a desolation, and Edom shall be a desolate wilderness, for the violence against the children of Judah, in that they have shed innocent blood in their land.
